2024-02-29 19:40:00,Likely,laura is the best she was extremely supportive and kind throughout my appointment dr brodie was also amazing with my partner for his appointment however my appointment with dr may was not good and i don t feel comfortable talking to her again she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions that i was privately diagnosed with adhd but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the nhs logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is right to choose she immediately went on to mention the influx of private diagnoses and the bbc panorama whilst i understand her concerns her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable i was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively whilst she did backtrack from this once i explained how adhd affects my life which is why i got emotional how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist tv program as opposed to reliable sources and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that i may not be able to get medication when it isn t our fault as patients that the adhd waiting lists are so long i wouldn t mind doing a regular nhs assessment but the issue is that we can t access them not that we as patients don t want to and are choosing to pay for a diagnosis which i didn t anyhow i do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has my problem is that she didn t take an open minded curious approach and on top of that when i later read her notes on my record i realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect facts she recorded about my life as well as recording that i was upset that she needed to discuss things between the team which isn t the case at all i was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard and frustrated by the adhd system overall given how massively it impacts my life a more kind curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated and i don t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting i feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because i don t want to come across as difficult or pedantic or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care i have had largely positive interactions with the nhs but the negative ones including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it i try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from right to choose not in terms of referrals because i ve not experienced any issues there at all my past gp was great with this i haven t yet needed any at the chelsea practice but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try,,The Chelsea Practice,negative,0.5001375079154968,neutral,0.0,580,0,4.0,Doctor Consultations,

2024-03-01 03:06:00,Likely,there are certainly good points about the practice given the number of patients they have to deal with however the following are the weak points as far as i am concerned 1 constant change of doctors no permanent medical team no doctor there long enough to know the patients 2 referred for eco in feb 2022 after always being breathless seven months later i discovered results came back saying i needed constant bp monitoring but i never heard from the practice in this regard and until i spoke to dr doonga about my own bp reading of 200 over 107 that september i had no idea that i had a real problem since then several further tests carried out having been taken into c w by ambulance with fibrillation and tachycardia but am left not knowing where i go from here and have been given no advice or guidance regarding diet or exercise to help with my condition 3 will my medication ever be reviewed and if so when will i have further heart monitoring at some stage and if so when or has the box been ticked and nothing further will be done,,Health Partners @ Violet Melchett,negative,0.4966700375080108,neutral,0.0,194,0,4.0,Test Results,

2024-03-02 16:25:00,Likely,i joined the redcliffe surgery in 1965 that is nearly 60 years ago the current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the nhs the stupidity of brexit ever more pressure from ever more patients and much else i know it is harder and harder but if you want to improve there is room for improvement 1 my wife is almost 102 years of age i think anyone 80 yrs and more the genuine elderlies need much more careful watching and monitoring especially in regards to the need for follow up things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done as if the message never got through the follow up in the surgery needs improving more generally 2 it is often necessary to follow up with one s gp and getting through to them can feel like too many hoops to jump if i have a blood test and get a very technical feedback i won t understand it the gp out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically 3 i have been seen over months by the tissue viability department at st charles when no longer seen by them they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my after care was sent but when i raised this with my gp there was general non compression about what tv expected the surgery to do i was left hanging in the air and when an emergency arose neither gp nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do 4 mostly those answering the phone do a good job especially the person who has been there the longest though occasionally messages get confused or are somehow lost in translation so to speak 5 empathy can be taught the human element aids healing i once was with a gp who as i tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health was looking at their watch givimng the impression as sub text please go as fast as you can is not good it is anti healing the most basic and worst mistake 6 i think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback and make constructive criticism on a regular basis maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors cante wasteya dr jamie moran 19sept1945 poorwolf com 0207 370 3654 ps= some elderly patients will not have computers and will not be able to contact you online some will not have the computer skills that my grand daughter had at 7 years of age,,Health Partners @ Violet Melchett,negative,0.6946408152580261,neutral,0.0,436,0,4.0,Follow-Up and Continuity of Care,

2024-03-06 11:20:00,Extremely unlikely,getting an in person appointment is a rarity as a family we are in relative good health so we only go to the doctors when something really doesn t feel right follow up is non existent unless initiated by oneself the doctor never follows up test results are not related and unless something is out of the expected range there is no follow up to tell you about it or if the symptoms continue to discuss alternative routes of action when readings are slightly out of range doesnt appear to know how to interpret them and relies on the labs notes if a specialist appointment is suggested always pushed down the private route despite the fact we no longer have private insurance and greatly discouraged of following the nhs route don t you read the press delays are inormous in hospital referrals but that is perhaps our personal experience in particular with dr chua my daughter was also diagnosed with faecal impaction at a e in c w we followed the protocol suggested and at that time there was a young doctor who helped tremendously she did do follow ups in fact she scheduled them and would call in to check on progress sadly the young lady left the practice very soon before leaving she called us to let us know that she was leaving and to reassure us that she had discussed our case in details with the colleague that would be taking over no one from the practice ever called after this lady left what is chronic constipation that doesn t clear over a couple of months despite obscene doses of movicol in a child coupled with considerable weight loss clearly an irrelevance to this practice or at least that is what you felt like telephone appointments never run on time which is to be expected but if you miss the call after two rings forget the doctor calling you back you have to start a lengthy and convoluted chasing exercise you feel a mere number and an inconvenience at this surgery certainly not a good patient experience the doctors appear not to care at all,,The Abingdon Health Centre,negative,0.754253089,neutral,0.0,358,0,1.0,Test Results,

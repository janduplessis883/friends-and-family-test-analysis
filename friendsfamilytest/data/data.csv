16/02/2024 11:02,Neither likely nor unlikely,i have not had a recent appointmen but i thought i would answer anyway my experience is that when i need a doctor i find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent i need to have a telephone consultation first i was once told i think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that i had had for months after a laryngitis and i wanted to know if there was a cough medicine i could take i was told i should go to a and e but it was not that urgent i just needed advice i was quite disappointed and then went to a private gp she saw me the day afterwards scheduled a chest xray and got me a prescription also some friends of my age we are all oldies get check ups by their gp but so far i have had to ask for blood tests sometimes asked for by my cardiologist sometimes because i felt a long time had gone by i am aware that covid has been very detrimental for everybody patients and doctors from many points of view and my problems are minor compared to others however as a result i am stuck seeing a private dermatologist my check ups for a suspicious mole on my back i live alone and have no way to check this myself were continuously cancelled or postponed but i needed it to be seen on consultant s advice in three months admittedly this was not the gp it was the hospital now i would be happy to see the gp for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations so it would be useful to have a regular check up that is my point i have been seen by different doctors not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid problem i have been impressed with the notices i receive for vaccinations and general information like recently when i was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation i would have come but was out of the country the staff at the reception is always helpful and kind,i think maybe that the distinction in urgent and non urgent can be off putting when one just maybe needs reassurance or advice and does want to wait two weeks to talk to a doctor what is considered urgent it is really all relative and especially when one is older and lives alone maybe i was unlucky but now i hesitate calling thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my experience i know i need to be thankful that i have access to care at all,Stanhope Mews West,negative,0.5928822755813599,neutral,0.5268298983573914,365,88,3,Appointment Availability,Patient Respect

29/02/2024 12:21,Unlikely,i have recently moved to the area from australia and registered at this practice i was needed a repeat prescription for a medication i have been on for around 5 years i was given a phone appointment which is ok however as i have never been to the practice nor ever been to a gp in the uk i was expecting to have an in person appointment i was lucky to get a same day phone appointment the problems started while on the phone to the gp stated they don t often prescribe the medication i am usually on but could give be a months dose and gave me a list of alternative medications my concern is that this medication is an antidepressants that i have been stable on for 5 years from my understanding the practice and gps do not want to prescribe me the medication as it cost the practice more than alternatives which have not worked for me the past the gp is putting their need wants ahead of the patient that they are meant to be caring for if the practice refuses to continue to prescribe this medication for me i will have to look into a private go which as a nurse working in the nhs is not an sustainable option for me,,Health Partners @ Violet Melchett,neutral,0.7473798394203186,neutral,0.6808651089668274,217,0,2,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,

06/03/2024 11:20,Extremely unlikely,getting an in person appointment is a rarity as a family we are in relative good health so we only go to the doctors when something really doesn t feel right follow up is non existent unless initiated by oneself the doctor never follows up test results are not related and unless something is out of the expected range there is no follow up to tell you about it or if the symptoms continue to discuss alternative routes of action when readings are slightly out of range doesnt appear to know how to interpret them and relies on the labs notes if a specialist appointment is suggested always pushed down the private route despite the fact we no longer have private insurance and greatly discouraged of following the nhs route don t you read the press delays are inormous in hospital referrals but that is perhaps our personal experience in particular with dr person my daughter was also diagnosed with faecal impaction at a e in c w we followed the protocol suggested and at that time there was a young doctor who helped tremendously she did do follow ups in fact she scheduled them and would call in to check on progress sadly the young lady left the practice very soon before leaving she called us to let us know that she was leaving and to reassure us that she had discussed our case in details with the colleague that would be taking over no one from the practice ever called after this lady left what is chronic constipation that doesn t clear over a couple of months despite obscene doses of movicol in a child coupled with considerable weight loss clearly an irrelevance to this practice or at least that is what you felt like telephone appointments never run on time which is to be expected but if you miss the call after two rings forget the doctor calling you back you have to start a lengthy and convoluted chasing exercise you feel a mere number and an inconvenience at this surgery certainly not a good patient experience the doctors appear not to care at all,,The Abingdon Health Centre,negative,0.754253089,neutral,0.6808651089668274,353,0,1,Follow-up and Continuity of Care,

I recently had the pleasure of visiting the GP surgery in West London, and I must say, the experience exceeded my expectations. From the moment I stepped in, I was greeted by a warm and welcoming environment, which immediately put me at ease.

The reception staff were incredibly helpful and efficient, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free check-in process. Their professionalism and kindness set a positive tone for the rest of my visit.

The waiting area was clean and comfortable, creating a calm atmosphere. Despite the busy schedule, my appointment started on time, which I greatly appreciated. The surgery clearly values patients' time, a trait that is increasingly rare in healthcare settings.

My consultation with the GP was exceptionally good. The doctor was not only knowledgeable and thorough but also genuinely caring and attentive. They took the time to listen to my concerns, answer my questions, and explain my treatment options in a way that was easy to understand. It's rare to find a GP who combines such high levels of expertise with a truly compassionate approach.

I was also impressed by the surgery's use of technology. They have a user-friendly system for booking appointments and managing prescriptions, making it convenient to handle healthcare needs. This modern approach is a testament to their commitment to patient care and satisfaction.","Dedicated Mental Health Professionals: Having mental health specialists, such as psychologists or counsellors, available on-site or via telehealth appointments would provide patients with easier access to mental health care. This could be particularly helpful for those who might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of seeking help outside the GP surgery.",Earls Court Surgery,218.0,50,5.0,,,positive,0.9773790836334229,Mental Health Support,Prescription and Medication Management

2024-02-15 12:45:29,Likely,"My appointment with Dr. [PERSON] was Extremely likely and she was extremely empathetic and helpful. 
However, list below the problems about the way the surgery is being run, which I hope will be taken seriously, as I know many other patients who have the same concerns.

The changes to the practice since before Covid have not been an improvement. The reception staff's attitude has changed considerably and from a patient point of view not for the better.  There is no empathy and a reluctance to be constructively helpful, which verges on rudeness.
I have experienced finally getting through on the phone after waiting a long time, only to be told I am past the cutoff so have to call back at 2.00.   There ought to be a number reserved for people like me who care for an elderly person with dementia and who doesn't know how the day will pan out - I can't always be hanging on the phone at 8.30 in the morning or 2.00 pm.   My husband is 91, has vascular dementia and mobility problems.  

Recently I witnessed one of your receptionists remark to a patient,  who arrived clearly in distress and  trying to see a doctor for an emergency appointment at 11.15, that she was too late and anyway would need to speak to a doctor on the phone before she could get a face to face.  The distressed lady who was having trouble with her breathing said that A&E had told her to come to her surgery if she experienced breathing trouble again. The receptionist offered no empathy or support - remember that A&E had instructed this lady to go to her GP.  All your receptionist could repeat to her was she would have to call on the phone at 2.00 for an appointment for an initial telephone triage with a doctor.  
The receptionist then stated that a drop in surgery would be chaos, clearly she hadn't been in the job very long because one of the main reasons we transferred to [PERSON]hope Mews West surgery from Redcliffe was precisely because there was a daily drop in surgery and it was never chaos.

See below my most recent incident at your surgery, as an illustration of the calibre and attitude of your reception staff.

At the beginning of January, I brought in a urine sample for my husband, having been instructed to do so on Christmas Eve by the out of hours doctor.  My husband actually spent Christmas day and Boxing day in the [PERSON] & Westminster with Covid as well as a UTI.  On discharge the [PERSON] & Westminster doctor also confirmed I should bring a sample to the surgery for follow up testing.  I brought in the sample and the lady at reception told me that she couldn't help because I had no form and no doctor from the practice had requested the sample.  After much pleading she reluctantly agreed to contact a practice doctor for a form.  Why she couldn't consult my husband's records to see what had happened to him over Christmas, I do not know.   After nearly half an hour, another lady from reception asked her how she had contacted the doctor about my husband's sample.  By email, came the reply.  The other lady then told her to message a doctor and came out to see me.  She apologised for the unhelpful attitude and said it shouldn't have happened.  I nearly wrote to complain then but my life is complicated looking after my husband, so I didn't.  This survey has given me the opportunity to air my grievances.

2024-02-16 11:02:58,Neither likely nor unlikely,"I have not had a recent appointmen but I thought I would answer anyway. My experience is that when I need a doctor, I find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent,  I need to have a telephone consultation first.
 I was once told, I think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that I had had for months after a laryngitis and I wanted to know if there was a cough medicine I could take. .I was told I should go to A and E but it was not THAT urgent, I just needed advice. I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP. She saw me the day afterwards, scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription.  
Also, some friends of my age, (we are all oldies) get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests, sometimes asked for by my cardiologist, sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by.
  
I am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody, patients and doctors from many points of view and my ""problems"" are minor compared to others. However, as a result   I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist. My check ups for a suspicious mole (on my back, I live alone and have no way to check this myself) were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen, on consultant's advice ""in three months"". Admittedly, this was not the GP, it was the hospital. Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations.

So, it would be useful to have a regular check up, that is my point.

I have been seen by different doctors, not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid ""problem"". 
I have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information, like recently, when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation. I would have come but was out of the country!
The staff at the reception is always helpful and kind. 
 
","I think maybe, that the distinction in ""urgent"" and ""non urgent""  can be off putting when one just maybe needs reassurance or advice and does want to wait two weeks to talk to a doctor. What is considered urgent? It is really all relative and especially when one is older and lives alone.  Maybe I was unlucky  but now I hesitate calling.

Later i thought, no wonder people are asking so many questions - it’s so difficult to get an appointment to see a doctor. -  i wasn’t there is a limit to how many questions a patient is permitted  to ask.

You can’t diagnose chest infections over the phone. Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs, hips and groin and was not seem at all. Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers. She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would. Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs. I miss the old surgery when there was a walk-in for more urgent enquiries, and there was better client care.

2024-02-22 15:55:41,Unlikely,"It’s very frustrating the process of booking any appointments, the waiting time to see a doctor is for a phone call with the doctors 1week while for a in person appointment is 2 weeks. Receptionists take liberty to decide if you are urgent or not and booking the appointments accordingly saying the doctors are busy, then when you go in person there isn’t anyone in the clinic and doctors are free. The doctors take everything lightly and they don’t even check your symptoms, refuse to make referrals to the NHS and suggest to go privately. Sometimes i wait 2-3months before seeing my GP as I know the answer will always be “you have nothing so don’t worry” by only looking my face.

Follow-up with repeat prescriptions &c are also excellent.  There have been a few occasions in the past when individuals on the reception desk have seemed brusque or impatient though I can't imagine this was intentional, and more recently they have been much more welcoming and helpful.  Perhaps an NHS-wide issue is inter-site/department communication between specialist hospital provision and surgery monitoring, resulting in duplication of procedures such as blood pressure and other function tests.  For example, I have a wide spectrum of tests at Chelsea & Westminster twice a year as part of my ongoing HIV management, but I suspect these are not passed to you (despite my permission to do so).

I have a very stressful and busy job and 8am is when I need to commute. I either lose my job or suffer health problems as you dare not ring at any other time or reception will snap at you and tell you the next non emergency appointment is in 2026. If you do get an appointment it’s on the phone, then the Dr gets you to come in anyway… It’s double the time spent on an issue cos the reception staff on the phone flat out refuse to let you bypass the pointless phone calls. Huge changes are needed at this surgery, it’s an utter disgrace! The Drs are Extremely likely if you ever get to see one. The reception staff are extremely obstructive and devoid of common sense. They live and die by what the computer tells them. I understand that the Tories have defunded the NHS massively, but the reception staff could at least try a little to help more. I’m sick to the teeth of paying an outrageous amount in tax that pays your staffs wages to be treated like crap and never get a Drs appointment. I have gone private multiple times over the last few years cos of how bad this survey is. Shame on you all.

However there is no consistency and no follow through.  After being referred to a specialist department for further investigation, the box is ticked and the patient is cast adrift and left to sink or swim, because unless they make a fuss and pester the practice after the referral, they are not contacted again.  Half the problem is that the doctors are never in the practice for any length of time. Just as the patient gets to know a doctor and more Importantly the doctor gets to know the patient and take an interest in them,  the doctor is moved on and the patient has lost the invaluable link with someone who is familiar with their medical history - it is just a conveyor belt of people on the move and the insight and help a doctor can provide through personal knowledge of the patient is lost. The thing is, not all practices are like this.  Friends in Forest Gate, with a tremendous diversity of patients from all over the world where a team of interpreters is on standby, tell me the NHS treatment they receive from their local GP Practice is outstanding and very personal with patients being rung by doctors to see how they are doing and same day appointments are nearly always available.

If I were holding a fevered baby and had a crying two year old clinging to my legs, I would be angry at being told to treat you with courtesy and to use your website.  In a worried state, I wouldn’t be an able to navigate your website or any other!
My only appointment  in a long time was in January this year for bronchitis.   I was seen by a doctor I had never heard of who prescribed Amoxicillin.  After seven days on this, I was in a worse state and several friends told me it always was  a useless antibiotic.   A private doctor then put me on Zithromax for five days which finally had an effect.  I conclude that Amoxicillan must be the cheapest antibiotic but a false economy which set back my recovery.
Fortunately, I have not yet had to experience being told I can have an appointment in two weeks’ time.  When one knows one needs attention, this is untenable.

Whilst I can manage the online patchs system, I'm sure older patients have an absolute nightmare with it. That said, often patchs is unavailable and I think it should be possible to submit a request 24/7 and not have the system so frequently closed.

finally, I was upset at my recent smear test. Just after the test was completed as I was talking to the nurse by her desk, a male dr knocked on the door and came straight in without waiting for a response. Had he done that just a few minutes earlier, I would have been mid test. The nurse said she had locked the door, but this hadn't been done. I don't think it's acceptable that if a nurse or dr is with a patient that the appt is interrupted - the dr only wanted a blood pressure arm band and if that had happened during my test, I would have been furious and made a formal complaint.

However, your out of hours system is excellent, and being able to see the out of hours doctors over the weekend is fantastic. The option of smear test, blood test and more besides over the weekend is brilliant. And [PERSON] on Reception is lovely - so kind, helpful and efficient.

2024-02-29 12:21:53,Unlikely,"I have recently moved to the area from Australia and registered at this practice. I was needed a repeat prescription for a medication I have been on for around 5 years. I was given a phone appointment which is ok however as I have never been to the practice nor ever been to a gp in the uk I was expecting to have an in person appointment. I was lucky to get a same day phone appointment. The problems started while on the phone to the gp, stated they don’t often prescribe the medication I am usually on, but could give be a months dose and gave me a list of alternative medications. My concern is that this medication is an antidepressants that I have been stable on for 5 years. From my understanding the practice and gps do not want to prescribe me the medication as it cost the practice more than alternatives which have not worked for me the past. The gp is putting their need/ wants ahead of the patient that they are meant to be caring for. If the practice refuses to continue to prescribe this medication for me I will have to look into a private go which as a nurse working in the nhs is not an sustainable option for me",,Health Partners @ Violet Melchett,217.0,0,2.0,,,neutral,0.7898564338684082,,Telephone Service

2024-02-29 19:40:55,Likely,"[PERSON] is the best, she was extremely supportive and kind throughout my appointment. Dr [PERSON] was also amazing with my partner for his appointment. However, my appointment with Dr [PERSON] was not good and I don’t feel comfortable talking to her again, she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions (that I was privately diagnosed with ADHD), but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the NHS logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is Right To Choose, she immediately went on to mention the “influx of private diagnoses” and the BBC panorama, whilst I understand her concerns, her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable. I was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively, whilst she did backtrack from this once I explained how ADHD affects my life (which is why I got emotional), how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist TV program, as opposed to reliable sources, and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that I may not be able to get medication when it isn’t our fault as patients that the ADHD waiting lists are so long, I wouldn’t mind doing a regular NHS assessment but the issue is that we can’t access them, not that we (as patients) don’t want to and are choosing to “pay for a diagnosis” (which I didn’t anyhow). I do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has, my problem is that she didn’t take an open minded curious approach, and on top of that when I later read her notes on my record I realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect (facts she recorded about my life), as well as recording that I was “upset that she needed to discuss things between the team” which isn’t the case at all, I was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard, and frustrated by the ADHD system overall given how massively it impacts my life. A more kind, curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated, and I don’t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting. I feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because I don’t want to come across as difficult or pedantic, or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care. I have had largely positive interactions with the NHS but the negative ones, including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns, have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it, I try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it’s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from Right to Choose, not in terms of referrals because I’ve not experienced any issues there at all, my past GP was great with this (I haven’t yet needed any at the Chelsea practice), but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try",,The Chelsea Practice,567.0,0,4.0,,,positive,0.7531001567840576,,Doctor Consultations

If I have any beef, it’s the inconsistency with girls on reception… they all wish to help but I think the inundation telephone calls must be just dreadful with all the demands placed upon them from (what I have actually witnessed in reception is:  unreasonable impatience, demands + such rudeness & hostility towards them at times that it is, UNBELIEVABLE). … naturally & understandable this can reflect back upon  the next patient, unless they are-able to deal with it in such a way as it , ‘Not being personal’; like ‘Water off a Ducks Back’, BUT HOW DO THEY not TAKE THAT HOME!? And further,  day-in & day-out must be pretty challenging, Believe you are on top of it and able to deal with it….

It is a little confusing knowing which surgery to enter to acknowledge your arrival for appointment. I have been sent backwards and forwards with reception staff not knowing location of GP.

1) Constant change of doctors - no permanent medical team.  No doctor there long enough to know the patients.
2) Referred for ECO in Feb 2022 after always being breathless. Seven months later I discovered results came back saying I needed constant BP monitoring, but I never heard from the practice in this regard and until I spoke to Dr [PERSON] about my own BP reading of 200 over 107 that September, I had no idea that I had a real problem!  Since then several further tests carried out, having been taken into C&W by ambulance with fibrillation and tachycardia, but am left not knowing where I go from here and have been given no advice, or guidance regarding diet or exercise to help with my condition.  
3) Will my medication ever be reviewed and if so, when?  Will I have further heart monitoring at some stage and if so when, or has the box been ticked and nothing further will be done?",,Health Partners @ Violet Melchett,194.0,0,4.0,,,neutral,0.5157885551452637,,Test Results

The digital communication between my Sjogren's Syndrome consultant at Charing Cross and the doctors at my surgery is excellent.  When my consultant recently sent a letter with a suggestion to the GPs, a GP contacted me the next day via PATCHS with this suggestion for further treatment if I wanted it.  The PATCHS system is used very well by me and the surgery's admin team to very quickly provide me with repeat prescriptions, send messages to a GP or the admin team, make an appointment, etc.  But, of course, there are so many patients and so few doctors to cover such a large practice that getting a speedy face-to-face appointment is impossible- unless the info a patient enters into PATCHS suggests that the symptoms indicate an emergency situation.  But fortunately and knock on wood, at 80, soon to be 81, I very rarely have any need to request an appointment.

2024-03-02 16:25:13,Likely,"I joined the Redcliffe Surgery in 1965. That is nearly 60 years ago. The current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear, partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the NHS, the stupidity of Brexit, ever more pressure from ever more patients, and much else. I know it is harder and harder.. BUT, if you want to improve, there is room for improvement. 
[1] My wife is almost 102 years of age. I think anyone 80 yrs and more, the genuine  elderlies, need much more careful watching, and monitoring, especially in regards to the need for follow-up. Things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done, as if the message never got through. 
The follow-up in the surgery needs improving more generally.
[2] It is often necessary to follow up with one's GP, and getting through to them can feel like  too many hoops to jump. If I have a blood test and get a very technical feedback, I won't understand it. The GP out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically. 
[3] I have been seen over months by the Tissue Viability department at St Charles. When no longer seen by them, they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my 'after care' was sent. But when I raised this with my GP, there was general non compression about what TV expected the surgery to do! I was left hanging in the air, and when an emergency arose, neither GP nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do. 
[4] Mostly those answering the phone do a good job -- especially the person who has been there the longest -- though occasionally messages get confused, or are somehow lost in translation, so to speak.
[5] Empathy can be taught. The human element aids healing. I once was with a GP who, as I tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health, was looking at their watch. Givimng the impression, as sub-text, 'please go as fast as you can' is not good. It is anti-healing, the most basic and worst mistake. 
[6] I think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback, and make constructive criticism, on a regular basis. Maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors.

cante wasteya,
Dr [PERSON]

I work in a school, so it makes sense to get an appointment in the school holidays, yet, this is impossible as you can’t book in advance - not sure why.  You gave to call on the day and wait in a long queue.  We don’t have a fixed doctor, so you see anybody who happens to be around. I was booked in for a blood test and the nurse who saw me was sweeping the floor as I entered the room and then stated she was not able to take blood!  I came away feeling that perhaps she was the cleaning lady and there was a mix up.   My daughter has also had a terrible experience at your clinic.  
It is hardly surprising that the A&E are bursting over, as from my experience taking my daughter there, not many people waiting looked an emergency.  I feel due to the way doctors surgeries are run.

2024-03-05 09:51:04,Neither likely nor unlikely,"This practice used to be excellent but has deteriorated since 2020. The Practice Manager is Extremely likely and rang me immediately after I complained to a doctor. 
Main issues are:
1. Inefficient reception staff. Any time I phone there can be at least a 10 minute wait for an answer. There were 4 at a recent visit but only one was dealing with patients, the others were staring at screens. Later, there were SIX staff, all looking confused.
On my last visit I heard a patient being told by the little Asian female receptionist that Chelsea & Westminster Hospital was on Kings Rd - I had to tell him the correct location.  
2. A plastic screen stands between staff and patients meaning neither side can hear properly without shouting, often private details. The screen has been dirty though it had been cleaned when I went yesterday, maybe due to my comment to the Practice Manager. It should be removed, just causes frustration.
3. There’s not a feeling of respect by many staff, just that you’re an inconvenience. 
4. It’s very hard to see a doctor face-to-face. Phone appointments are inconvenient as there is no set time given in the day, so very hard particularly if you’re working.",,Knightsbridge Medical Centre,207.0,0,3.0,,,negative,0.8778381943702698,,Reception Staff Interaction

2024-03-06 11:20:04,Extremely unlikely,"Getting an in person appointment is a rarity. As a family we are in relative good health so we only go to the doctors when something really doesn’t feel right. Follow up is non existent unless initiated by oneself. The doctor never follows up. Test results are not related and unless something is out of the expected range, there is no follow up to tell you about it or if the symptoms continue to discuss alternative routes of action. When readings are slightly out of range, doesnt appear to know how to interpret them and relies on the labs notes…
If a specialist appointment is suggested, ALWAYS pushed down the private route (despite the fact we no longer have private insurance) and greatly discouraged of following the nhs route (‘don’t you read the press? Delays are inormous in hospital referrals). But that is perhaps our personal experience in particular with Dr [PERSON].
My daughter was also diagnosed with faecal impaction at A&E in C&W. We followed the protocol suggested and at that time there was a young doctor who helped tremendously. She DID do follow ups. In fact she scheduled them and would call in to check on progress. Sadly, the young lady left the practice very soon. Before leaving, she called us to let us know that she was leaving and to reassure us that she had discussed our case in details with the colleague that would be taking over. No one from the practice ever called after this lady left. What is chronic constipation that doesn’t clear over a couple of months despite obscene doses of movicol in a child, coupled with considerable weight loss? Clearly an irrelevance to this practice, or at least that is what you felt like.
Telephone appointments never run on time, which is to be expected, but if you miss the call after two rings, forget the doctor calling you back… you have to start a lengthy and convoluted chasing exercise.
You feel a mere number and an inconvenience at this surgery. Certainly not a good patient experience. The doctors appear not to care at all.",,The Abingdon Health Centre,353.0,0,1.0,,,negative,0.8138799667358398,,Test Results

2024-03-06 14:56:36,Neither likely nor unlikely,"Almost impossible to get through on the phone, so I resort to sending long messages on the website or via system online. 

Messages received from a doc by phone are read only, impossible to reply.

When booking an appointment online many doctors in the surgery are simply not listed , this does not make any sense.

There should be an online system where you can tick a box saying you are available for cancellations (my dentist operates like this).

At my last look, it is only possible to book telephone appointments online, but as its impossible to get through on the phone (it rings and rings and then goes to a very long recorded message and then hangs up - not possible to leave a voice message), its therefore impossible to book face to face appointments.  Reception staff have said to me a number of times that the system is down. I believe they, too, are frustrated.

Thank you.

I have had many investigations and was finally diagnosed with Fibromyalgia after a long time. Until diagnosis I had to be in contact with my practice for many tests and titrations of pain medication. They are so busy but professional and responsive to my needs. They do the right thing at the right time. Dr [PERSON] sometimes even mans the phones himself to help his reception team and to deal with queries immediately. He does this, he said to know what it’s like on the shop floor. I have felt frustrated at times and have been grumpy and unreasonable, even then, they have been kind and compassionate. Many GPs have no time, but I never feel rushed at The Good Practice, they are just good. Special thanks to Dr [PERSON] too for her time, patience and care. I always receive sterling service, here. Huge thanks to the whole team team too, they make the patient  experience feel safe and comfortable every time.

2024-03-06 15:49:36,Likely,Very very difficult to access help - not their fault as I am aware how understaffed and busy they are but as someone who lives with a long term mental health condition being told constantly that things aren’t possible is not easy. The GP I spoke to recently was very nice and helpful as is the nurse I’ve seen at the practice but reception staff have often given me the wrong information (leading to a serious issue with medication) or been very cold in manner which is off putting when trying to access help and support. Whilst I appreciate that having online services makes things easier for the practice I feel that it is illogical to expect people to feel safe operating in this way when it comes to their health. For me personally having a little more human contact and reassurance would go a long way to helping me manage my condition the best way I can. ,,Earls Court Medical Centre,158.0,0,4.0,,,negative,0.8676686882972717,,Reception Staff Interaction

A ring back system on the phone line so that one does not have to wait to get through for an unknown period of time is needed. You should be able to ring back numbers that elect for a call back. It's really difficult if you are working and impossible for mothers with young children often to stay on the phone for that period of time - often the children cut off the calls! I am also uneasy how rarely one does get to see a Dr in person and I fear  things don't necessarily get picked up - the kind of things one mentions on the way out but which turn out to be important. Just by looking at someone a good GP can tell a lot. I also think it's not great if a patient has an issue such as depression but which they haven't identified themselves. The times I have been very depressed have both been identified by two doctors outside the practice and they were right. I appreciate resources are very stretched and I do think this is a good practice generally, especially when compared with others.

I can always rest assured I will be seen soon. They also have regular PPG meetings and have weekly classes to attend like yoga, choir and walks. This just shows how committed they are to their community of patients and our well being. The Good Practice should be a case study for “good practices” and emulated at all the other GP surgeries.

I am emailed some info and then the contents of the email are denied.  When urgent help is requested it is not followed up.  When this is pointed out to reception, the phone is put down on me with comment ""don't know about that....""  Now when I have problems I think it is pointless to go to the surgery as feel it will be trivialised.  An HCA was very rude to me, telling me to ""be quiet"" and when I wrote in complaining I was told it would be investigated and I would be told the outcome.  I heard nothing more.

Occasionally I get an invitation for shingles vaccines too which I assume is rampant as the populations immunity to zoster virus appears to be damaged by the mRNAs.

I know my blood pressure is high. I am working with a GP at Earls Court medical to get it under control. If I input a high number, I'm told I urgently need to make an appointment with my GP - which I have already done... because we're monitoring my blood pressure closely. Moreover, the survey timing seems random and often wrong: I was told I had two weeks to submit a reading (I have that in writing), but the survey expired after a week. Finally, I was supposed to be called by a pharmacist doctor to review my medication. I cleared time on my schedule for this and... nothing. Clearly, things aren't joined up and this is simply unacceptable. I am a patient and a person. I'm not a box that can be ticked once a text has been sent to my phone. This is no way to practice medicine. It's striking there are amazing people like [PERSON] and Dr [PERSON] and Dr [PERSON] at ECMC - and many of the receptionists are lovely too. But the surgery's AI/digital presence is dehumanising and so is the 'I' who is requesting blood pressure readings from me.

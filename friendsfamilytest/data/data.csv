the reception staff were incredibly helpful and efficient ensuring a smooth and hasslefree checkin process their professionalism and kindness set a positive tone for the rest of my visit

the waiting area was clean and comfortable creating a calm atmosphere despite the busy schedule my appointment started on time which i greatly appreciated the surgery clearly values patients time a trait that is increasingly rare in healthcare settings

my consultation with the gp was exceptionally good the doctor was not only knowledgeable and thorough but also genuinely caring and attentive they took the time to listen to my concerns answer my questions and explain my treatment options in a way that was easy to understand its rare to find a gp who combines such high levels of expertise with a truly compassionate approach

i was also impressed by the surgerys use of technology they have a userfriendly system for booking appointments and managing prescriptions making it convenient to handle healthcare needs this modern approach is a testament to their commitment to patient care and satisfaction",dedicated mental health professionals having mental health specialists such as psychologists or counsellors available onsite or via telehealth appointments would provide patients with easier access to mental health care this could be particularly helpful for those who might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of seeking help outside the gp surgery,Earls Court Surgery,218,50,5,,,positive,0.977272153,Mental Health Support,0.340330579,0.627369146,0,0.726,0.274,0.9954,Prescription and Medication Management

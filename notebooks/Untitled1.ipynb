      "Not really . Staff are always helpful. \n",
      "Not really as everything was as smooth as could have been wished\n",
      "Blood sample went through to lab ok\n",
      "No. Very impressed with the service. \n",
      "no but i guess not having to go at all ( therefore one is well)\n",
      "Yes for the receptionist to know that you have to be 25 to do the test not 24 and for me to have been sent the text when I am 25!\n",
      "Can't think of anything at the moment.\n",
      "The majority of the receptionist are lovely but I think some are a bit blunt \n",
      "It would have been better if the email sent to me by [PERSON] could have been communicated to the nurse and reception be more attentive as I clearly mentioned I had received an email regarding carer assessment. I have already sent an email regarding this . Thank you \n",

      "I think when receiving a text message there always a link to book appointment but it seems to me the calendar of the practice is not automatically updated. \n",
      "My last visit was exactly as I hoped. [PERSON] especially is a kind, caring and supportive individual. \n",
      "I would have liked to have had a face to face consultation sooner than 14 days, but it was not urgent and I believe that had it been, a doctor would have seen me very quickly. \n",
      "Would like to see at least one doctor more than once. No idea how that could possibly work any more. Sad.\n",
      "I do understand that times are tough but the overall service I would rate as excellent from everyone.  Thank you all. \n",
      "This was a telephone appointment - perhaps I will ask to come in next time.\n",

      "Well, turning back the clock, to happier times before Brexit, and the Wuhan Virus. \n",
      "Yes if it was easier to arrange an appointment either over the phone or face to face.  Currently it appears easier to go through the eye if a needle and I am not a camel. Not everyone should have to have a stopwatch on them during the call to make sure they are dead on time in order to get on the list of maybe speaking to a GP that day.  Also to be told it will be 2 weeks before you can speak to your specified GP is not acceptable especially if you are an elderly vulnerable patient who is scared and needs reassurance\n",
      "Since Covid it does seem that you have to wait much longer for an appointment \n",
      "just wish the reception could get my prescriptions right!\n",
      "Not having to answer surveys like the one - everybody is using them\n",

      "I regret that there isn’t a system of annual GP checkups, with clear notes that ensure continuity of care. Maintenance of health. \n",
      "\n",
      "For people like me with ongoing health issues it’s not effective to have to explain anew each time. Also strangely difficult to retain an oversight of health changes when my observations are subjective, not objective. \n",

      "No, I’m already pretty satisfied with the service \n",
      "Not that I can think of.\n",
      "No, I think I have the best experience with this GP surgery so far..\n",

      "Yes, getting help to address my issue\n",
      "Doing the very best you can given the circumstances.\n",
      "Reception staff ( not all) need to be a little more polite, understanding and helpful. It mostly feels like taking an enquiry is tiresome. \n",
      "Quicker response time to incoming calls.  I've tried using Patches as suggested to make an appointment and receive a message telling me to call the surgery to make an appointment !\n",
      "Yes making sure when I wait in line to be answered on the telephone that my call isn't hung up when it is my turn \n",
      "I would have loved to see the same doctor every time l visit because they know your history or problems.\n",
      "I miss the previous link between patient and particular doctor which certainly in my case proved beneficial, even life-saving. With the present surgery I find the turnover of doctors too great and disconcerting.\n",
      "No interview with the pressure under which you work p\n",
      "Shorter time to wait for an appointment to see the Doctor you know-often too long to wait for his/her availability.\n",
      "She should have taking into account how far I came from and ask gone to ask the nurse if ican be seen but she was in a hurry to turn me away instead. And that was my first time at the 1a address for a check up. I think it was a Unlikely customer service experience I have ever had.\n",
      "The end of the telephone routine before the possibility of face to face\n",
      "Not speaking to a bot for my referral consultation \n",
      "The reception staff need to be more helpful \n",
      "Yes… the practitioner should have  been provided with appropriate modesty gown and a small curtained off area for patients to undress and prepare themselves appropriately . He was apologetic . I did not go through with the appointment - wasting my time and his. I have re-booked with a female practitioner and in the event that she is not equipped appropriately I will have my own with me. The doctor who made my telephone appointment assured me that the practitioner was highly experienced and would have all the necessary equipment when I enquired about the issue of modesty.  \n",
      "Not a good patient experience!\n",
      "I think the GPs in general need to listen a little better to the concerns of the patient \n",
      "No everything was seen to during the appointment \n",
      "I am very much happy and always thankful for their good service.\n",
      "I think maybe, that the distinction in \"urgent\" and \"non urgent\"  can be off putting when one just maybe needs reassurance or advice and does want to wait two weeks to talk to a doctor. What is considered urgent? It is really all relative and especially when one is older and lives alone.  Maybe I was unlucky  but now I hesitate calling. \n",
      "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my experience. I know I need to be thankful that I have access to care at all!\n",
      "The NHS and Doctors are under tremendous strain so i appreciate the fact that i was able to receive help. I guess i just wanted to feel like the Doctor realised how much we patients appreciate them. Instead i got the impression i had somehow annoyed her. Again though, we all have bad days so it’s ok. \n",
      "In my consultation there was a primary health care worker who communicated appropriately but also a second female whose presence went completely unexplained and who failed to communicate at all. What was she doing there and who should have introduced her / explained her presence ? Basically, customer communication remains poor at the surgery. I was already thinking of looking elsewhere and that instinct hasn’t changed.\n",
      "Less holding time on the telephone. More opportunity for face-to-face consultation. Closer doctor/patient relationship.\n",
      "An estimate of the length of the appointment . \n",
      "It would have been better if the present level of support had materialised earlier but the pandemic created havoc.\n",
      "I won’t see the same practitioner ever again and that might help in the future.\n",
      "The phones are sometimes busy, it would be great to an operator quicker when I call, although, there is a very convenient online systems to book appointments and I call in very rarely. \n",
      "In some instances reception staff over the phone can be a little rushed, but it is understandable due to the volume of calls\n",
      "less waiting time for appointments, less hassled receptionists- though I think there has been an improvvement in last few months\n",
      "I am very happy with the surgery\n",
      "So far in the  time that I'm visiting  these centre , I being  haven  a good  service.  I don't  have to complain  for anything  . Thank  you  .\n",
      "You need to Improv services of Farmsist and respect the customers .\n",
      "If the patient is really needs to be seen especially old people the vulnerable they should prioritise them to be seen not let them wait then comeback , thanks \n",
      "Sometimes one needs a follow up. \n",
      "Easier to make appointment ie not restricted to having to call back at 2pm\n",
      "Not that I can think of \n",
      "On time and fully prepared to do blood pressure reading\n",
      "It would be convenient to book a GP appointment online, but I understand the need to filter callers to best serve the urgent needs\n",
      "I feel she and the team at the practice have been both kind and helpful in helping/supporting me\n",
      "No for me everything is just right\n",
      "I am happy with the Chelsea Practice as it is \n",
      "Please still the same as you are \n",
      "It would seem that only sometimes & say only one out of 10 appointments the Dr's do not have enough time to listen to more than one problem. This can be unsettling for the elderly with several issues. \n",
      "No because I think they are always excellent \n",
      "Not that I can think about…..So far, so good\n",
      "Not really, all efforts are made to accommodate enquiries. Perhaps if there was more phone lines available, that would help with waiting to speak with a receptionist.\n",
      "My experience is Extremely likely, Surgery and doctors, I like them\n",
      "My wife is pregnant of 28 weeks, but they could not arrange any appointment for us in 3 weeks. They should be a bit serious if there is sensitive patients like mine. I got appointments after 3 weeks.\n",
      "Yes... A lot, I have learned to deal with my illness, with peace of mind and exercises.... In the hospital and GP they are like my family , los doctores son buenos profesionales 👌👍👍👍\n",
      "Trying to make appointments by telephone - often you will end up in quite a length queue which means that you have to retry several times\n",
      "Nothing about the service needs to be improved.\n",
      "More time for GP… and more options for sorting health issues \n",
      "Being able to respond to the GP’s text quickly with a response\n",
      "Very friendly staff! Unfortunately tech is not always the best - ex. printer broken and no way to send to print toi reception - but the team makes up for it. \n",
      "More Doctors like [PERSON]. Make it possible to differentiate better between very urgent and less urgent, and not urgent appointments - because with a 2 week wait for ‘non urgent’ appointments - people are inclined to say their appointment is urgent. \n",
      "No as per above … though I have noticed some of the new receptionists ( possibly on trial) have  seemed  very abrupt and detached … as though job was a bind !\n",
      "For doctors to carry out more face to face appointments. Also to try and keep seeing the same doctor is more difficult than prior to covid. I’m sure as to why doctors seem reluctant to see patients face to face more often \n",
      "Earlier date of the appointment would have been appreciated \n",
      "First appointment with the nurse was late which made me worry I may be late for my subsequent appointment with the doctor. Perhaps an indication of how late appointments are running would have saved the worry\n",
      "See in the doctor / GP in person so he/ she could actually see my swollen lymph. \n",
      "To receive test results directly by email\n",
      "It was a skin infection -- I would have liked to receive better advice on how to care for the wound while it was healing.\n",
      "Now I understand why many doctors/nurses just call patients. In my case it would have been better and would have not wasted my time\n",
      "Yes, I was booked for a smear test and a general health check up. I received a phone call a day before to say I should do both with the same nurse, not as two different appointments as had been arranged. When I got there, the nurse said she couldn't do the general health check up as that is done by someone else who has a specific machine. She suggested I phone the reception and make an appointment for next week. I explained that I'm away in Lincoln next week and for the remainder of the month, and at the end of the month, I'm working in Italy until July - which is why I wanted to get all of this done this week. The nurse said there was nothing she could do (which was probably true). She did the smear test, and did take my bloods. I shouldn't have been told that the nurse could do all when she couldn't, clearly. I will now have to wait until July before I can have a check up. \n",
      "The Problem is when something happens during week ends.....\n",
      "I received a text message for an appointment at the centre in the next 45 minutes. I rushed with my child to the clinic, only to hear it was a telephone appointment! Better communication next time please.\n",
      "Not having to wait such a long time for the surgery to answer the initial telephone call\n",
      "Not that I can think of.\n",
      "after many decades with the surgery it would be nice to have a regular doctor to consult\n",
      "Being assured of seeing the same Doctor\n",
      "If possible I would like to have the continuity of seeing the same doctor.\n",
      "No yes GPs should be committed for a period of few years so a patient can have a choice too. Not all on their terms. We pay tax for them as well to attend to our needs.\n",
      "The communication could occasionally be a better. I don't dare to ask for a quicker access to the services under the circumstances. \n",
      "Don't know how to directly contact doctor \n",
      "No, the telephone appointment with Dr [PERSON] was constructive and helpful for me.\n",
      "More information, more clear instructions, more follow up information\n",
      "Certain reception staff members showing they are overwhelmed and therefore showing their stress through being annoyed with patient. This is subtle but clearly visible. Also reception staff members that overindulge time waster patients when there is a long queue and only one receptionist. \n",
      "Yes hope the asthma  check  nurse and other tests  like blood  for diabetic  \n",
      "There  have [PERSON]  anderstand  like the doctors!\n",

      "Abit  \n",
      "The atmosphere of Health Partners @ Violet Melchett is nice and friendly. \n",
      "The on-line services are useable, and the reception staff are professional and helpful  Poably the on-line stuff is out of your hands, but encourage the reception staff to keep up their good work.\n",
      "Thank you for the help I have reeived especially over the last year.\n",
      "It is always preferable to speak to the receptionist for an appointment but this is not always quicker \n",
      "It is an excellent practice overall from the doctors to the nurses and the receptionists.\n",
      "That the nurse should be able to draw blood, without using me as a pin cushion.  Her manners were poor and she was in a rush, no professionalism.\n",
      "No, I was looked after brilliantly by your colleague\n",
      "Everything is really great!! I appriciatte!!\n",
      "Doctor who knew my case and could advise knowledgeably\n",
      "everything suits me at the moment\n",
      "Not at all please keep doing what you are doing!\n",
      "No please keep doing what you are doing\n",
      "Some of the receptionist need to learn patience when dealing with people that have mental health needs and people.\n",
      "I’m extremely happy , stay as it is for me.\n",
      "Being able to make appointment for blood test without re- seeing doctor \n",

      "It’s fine as it is. Many thanks \n",
      "Since past years things have become better \n",
      "Instead of cost cutting it would mice the doctor listen and follow up with patient further to see o\n",
      "D any improvement \n",
      "If she asked questions regarding my health\n",
      "One thing i think the online service it's limited for patients so if I want to make an appointment I can't choose face to face just phone appointment. That's is an issue for patients.\n",
      "No. Everyone is doing an excellent job.\n",
      "Quicker feed back after visits, blood test and other tests. The often very long period if there is a recall for an evaluation means that as a patient you do not know if the results have been lost, are positive or negative.\n",
      "A quick short notification that a result has been uploaded to the patient record would be enough, sent via email as a “new documents” or sms, and the patient can then check online rather than call to enquire.\n",
      "Change all the front desk staff …\n",
      "Yes, an ability to put my concerns to a doctor over the phone if necessary. \n",

      "Friendly staff at reception and Nurse [PERSON] is the best \n",
      "Saw a highly competent Doctor. Very pleased.\n",
      "Yes, as I pointed out at the time, it would have been far better to have the prostate inspection and blood test in one ten minute appointment, but I had to come back for two ten minute appointments - there would have been plenty of time. The prostate and blood tests took a total of six minutes to do. \n",
      "I took the trouble to write a note to your email to suggest this, but an automatic reply came back saying you don’t accept suggestions from patients or correspondence.\n",
      "It felt that a lot of extra work was being created - and it would instantly reduce the waiting lists if a more efficient system was adopted. \n",
      "Only if I had received the text to confirm my appointment \n",
      "Receptionists (bar one) should have better experience and more knowledge\n",
      "As far as the staff concerned they do a fantastic job my only problem is parking \n",
      "Possibly more time with doctor, although I also feel it’s my responsibility to use the time well.\n",
      "If the nurse had been allowed to do stitches it would have saved NHS A&Ehospital time and money\n",
      "To be honest: there was a young receptionist who was offensive, horrible, not just to me. I am old and should be impervious but it did make me feel sick and the memory still does. Courtesy and kindness make so much more difference when people are feeling vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "better organisation and management of subcontractors, Very substandard experience. Zero value to the patient\n",
      "Making it easier to book advance appointments.\n",
      "Yes, I would like some of the receptionist to be more friendly rather than aggressive when they answer the phone. They most to know that when we call that means we are suffering \n",

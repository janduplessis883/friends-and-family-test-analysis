Their professionalism and kindness set a positive tone for the rest of my visit.\\n\\nThe waiting area was clean and comfortable, creating a calm atmosphere. Despite the busy schedule, my appointment started on time, which I greatly appreciated. The surgery clearly values patients' time, a trait that is increasingly rare in healthcare settings.\\n\\nMy consultation with the GP was exceptionally good. The doctor was not only knowledgeable and thorough but also genuinely caring and attentive. They took the time to listen to my concerns, answer my questions, and explain my treatment options in a way that was easy to understand. It's rare to find a GP who combines such high levels of expertise with a truly compassionate approach.\\n\\nI was also impressed by the surgery's use of technology. They have a user-friendly system for booking appointments and managing prescriptions, making it convenient to handle healthcare needs. This modern approach is a testament to their commitment to patient care and satisfaction. Dedicated Mental Health Professionals: Having mental health specialists, such as psychologists or counsellors, available on-site or via telehealth appointments would provide patients with easier access to mental health care. This could be particularly helpful for those who might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of seeking help outside the GP surgery.\",\n",

The reception staff's attitude has changed considerably and from a patient point of view not for the better.  There is no empathy and a reluctance to be constructively helpful, which verges on rudeness.\\nI have experienced finally getting through on the phone after waiting a long time, only to be told I am past the cutoff so have to call back at 2.00.   There ought to be a number reserved for people like me who care for an elderly person with dementia and who doesn't know how the day will pan out - I can't always be hanging on the phone at 8.30 in the morning or 2.00 pm.   My husband is 91, has vascular dementia and mobility problems.  \\n\\nRecently I witnessed one of your receptionists remark to a patient,  who arrived clearly in distress and  trying to see a doctor for an emergency appointment at 11.15, that she was too late and anyway would need to speak to a doctor on the phone before she could get a face to face.  The distressed lady who was having trouble with her breathing said that A&E had told her to come to her surgery if she experienced breathing trouble again. The receptionist offered no empathy or support - remember that A&E had instructed this lady to go to her GP.  All your receptionist could repeat to her was she would have to call on the phone at 2.00 for an appointment for an initial telephone triage with a doctor.  \\nThe receptionist then stated that a drop in surgery would be chaos, clearly she hadn't been in the job very long because one of the main reasons we transferred to [PERSON]hope Mews West surgery from Redcliffe was precisely because there was a daily drop in surgery and it was never chaos.\\n\\nSee below my most recent incident at your surgery, as an illustration of the calibre and attitude of your reception staff.\\n\\nAt the beginning of January, I brought in a urine sample for my husband, having been instructed to do so on Christmas Eve by the out of hours doctor.  My husband actually spent Christmas day and Boxing day in the [PERSON] & Westminster with Covid as well as a UTI.  On discharge the [PERSON] & Westminster doctor also confirmed I should bring a sample to the surgery for follow up testing.  I brought in the sample and the lady at reception told me that she couldn't help because I had no form and no doctor from the practice had requested the sample.  After much pleading she reluctantly agreed to contact a practice doctor for a form.  Why she couldn't consult my husband's records to see what had happened to him over Christmas, I do not know.   After nearly half an hour, another lady from reception asked her how she had contacted the doctor about my husband's sample.  By email, came the reply.  The other lady then told her to message a doctor and came out to see me.  She apologised for the unhelpful attitude and said it shouldn't have happened.  I nearly wrote to complain then but my life is complicated looking after my husband, so I didn't.  This survey has given me the opportunity to air my grievances.

I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP. She saw me the day afterwards, scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription.  \\nAlso, some friends of my age, (we are all oldies) get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests, sometimes asked for by my cardiologist, sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by.\\n  \\nI am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody, patients and doctors from many points of view and my \"problems\" are minor compared to others. However, as a result   I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist. My check ups for a suspicious mole (on my back, I live alone and have no way to check this myself) were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen, on consultant\\'s advice \"in three months\". Admittedly, this was not the GP, it was the hospital. Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations.\\n\\nSo, it would be useful to have a regular check up, that is my point.\\n\\nI have been seen by different doctors, not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid \"problem\". \\nI have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information, like recently, when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation. I would have come but was out of the country!\\nThe staff at the reception is always helpful and kind.

After being referred to a specialist department for further investigation, the box is ticked and the patient is cast adrift and left to sink or swim, because unless they make a fuss and pester the practice after the referral, they are not contacted again.  Half the problem is that the doctors are never in the practice for any length of time. Just as the patient gets to know a doctor and more Importantly the doctor gets to know the patient and take an interest in them,  the doctor is moved on and the patient has lost the invaluable link with someone who is familiar with their medical history - it is just a conveyor belt of people on the move and the insight and help a doctor can provide through personal knowledge of the patient is lost. The thing is, not all practices are like this.  Friends in Forest Gate, with a tremendous diversity of patients from all over the world where a team of interpreters is on standby, tell me the NHS treatment they receive from their local GP Practice is outstanding and very personal with patients being rung by doctors to see how they are doing and same day appointments are nearly always available.

I was not told what to wear. I was told to continue doing everything normally which is not the case. If you are walking when it goes off or stretching your arm is reads an error and retakes the reading 1-2 minutes later. This basic information could have been provided to me. In the end I googled how to use it and found and information leaflet from another UK practice and followed their guidelines. All in all I would suggest you look into providing patients with more information about what to wear, not being able to shower while it is on, not being able to change clothes and also how to use the machine and that it keeps you awake all night as it goes off every hour so be prepared to be really tired the day after. All of this information is required and needs to be provided. Even just a link or QR code to an online document with all the details would be great.

Perhaps before taking an appointment you should check if your employees are available. On top of this, the day after the pharmacist said that the medicine I am taking is not available in the UK so she cancelled my current prescription and closed the call.

I explained that I'm away in Lincoln next week and for the remainder of the month, and at the end of the month, I'm working in Italy until July - which is why I wanted to get all of this done this week. The nurse said there was nothing she could do (which was probably true). She did the smear test, and did take my bloods.

Everybody at rhe surgery is friendly, dedicated & supportive I don\\'t  think so Because I\\'m very happy to the service I think work on Saturday I have made this clear to other members of staff. I feel Dr [PERSON] let me down and in fact was responsible for a gross dereliction of duty. She was very slow to respond to my symptoms and in retrospect did not think she believed me. She was irresponsible and failed in showing a duty of care towards me. Dr [PERSON] should have behaved as a responsible GP and sent me for further tests. I had heart failure and she had diagnosed me with asthma. I visited her 5/6 times in a space of a few months with symptoms that I now know were typical of heart failure but she  did nothing other than increase my cortisone. It was only when I attended a & e that I was diagnosed with heart failure. Neither she or her colleague Dr [PERSON] have apologised.  Naturally I am taking the matter further. The service is very good and staff are very friendly. I came to the surgery with my Son an old lady assaulted him. Call him names and nearly hit him with her working stick I don’t feel safe after being with the same surgery for more than 20 years. My son is still terrified about what happen to him.

I gavent visited this surgery since May 2023 Doctors have to update their knowledge because I don’t feel they have enough knowledge The doctors provide a really good service, very friendly and approachable. But the 2 receptionist are so unapproachable, superior and initmating. Yes, the superior and ignorant approach from the receptionists. All the staff, medical  & administrative, are  kind & helpful.  And there no long waiting queues to see a doctor. The surgery itself  needs a updating Not really as investment into physical infrastructure is no doubt a matter of  budgets Such nice staff & doctors No Efficient and polite staff Having a nurse on site during surgery hours Good for me No Excellent service by all the staff. No Extremely well run and handled by excellent receptionists and medical staff. Nothing at all needs changing.

The Surgery gets things done. From time to time it’s difficult to understand doctors ie calls via loudspeaker, accent when speaking fast, questions not addressed… I have been at this practice for the past 10 years and am satisfied. Only change is less time face to face. As I said lack of face to face. All staff is very hard for each time. I call you are very efficient. There’s nothing to be improved. As customer service is handling in a very professional way already Always prompt service I think it’s pretty good Efficient, polite and reassuring. No The staff are helpful to the patients.

Always seamless care. Nothing - everything was great Organized Quicker response time The staff in reception are always helpful and friendly and enable me to keep in touch with my GP without problems or delay No Friendly and efficient surgery Dr [PERSON] a great GP No Kind and friendly staff Continue doing the amazing job that you are already doing Response is always helpful and knowledgeable My visit was very straightforward and it went very well. It could’ve been any better. Did what I went in to do. No-one else there. No I find Dr [PERSON] friendly and  willing to discuss any problem No Dr is kind and nice. Not at this moment The Doctors is excellent in service… but the front desk staff needs to learn how dealing with people .. Just change all the front desk staff I been treated fairly Quicker appointments I been going to this surgery for over 15years and always looks after me If results can be texted or emailed Doctors are very good and knowledgable No. Close to C1 bus stop and tube station,   Trubador Garden in summee for a coffee,  prescriptions sent to chemist quickly after requests. I think stair rail not secure enough to downstairs and steep maybe instal a regular lift Every time I have to go to the surgery I am always treated well and feel welcome.

Always responding on time and no delay while waiting for response Everything is good She was so kind. Nothing special. Very good and quick service No The nurse [PERSON] was amazing as usual..thank you. Reception  team needs to be more professional, more helpful and less rude to patients.. I am happy with staff since 1995 almost 23 years No I feel totally let down by the surgery, in failing to source a Covid vaccination for me, so I could have it other than in my arms, where I have lymphoedema risk. Yes - looked into obtaining a Covid jab for me instead of just refusing to help, which is a total lack of care. I recently had the pleasure of visiting the GP surgery in West London, and I must say, the experience exceeded my expectations. From the moment I stepped in, I was greeted by a warm and welcoming environment, which immediately put me at ease.\\n\\nThe reception staff were incredibly helpful and efficient, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free check-in process. Their professionalism and kindness set a positive tone for the rest of my visit.\\n\\nThe waiting area was clean and comfortable, creating a calm atmosphere. Despite the busy schedule, my appointment started on time, which I greatly appreciated. The surgery clearly values patients\\' time, a trait that is increasingly rare in healthcare settings.\\n\\nMy consultation with the GP was exceptionally good. The doctor was not only knowledgeable and thorough but also genuinely caring and attentive. They took the time to listen to my concerns, answer my questions, and explain my treatment options in a way that was easy to understand. It\\'s rare to find a GP who combines such high levels of expertise with a truly compassionate approach.\\n\\nI was also impressed by the surgery\\'s use of technology. They have a user-friendly system for booking appointments and managing prescriptions, making it convenient to handle healthcare needs. This modern approach is a testament to their commitment to patient care and satisfaction. Dedicated Mental Health Professionals: Having mental health specialists, such as psychologists or counsellors, available on-site or via telehealth appointments would provide patients with easier access to mental health care. This could be particularly helpful for those who might feel overwhelmed by the prospect of seeking help outside the GP surgery. Very Happy with my General Practitioner, thank you. Would like to see normal blood results sent via SMS or the NHS App if possible, hopefully if it is not available now it will be in future. Could you please keep us updated. My experience at the GP Practice is always OK. Reception area not in the best manner, could be brighter to uplift the spirit when. visiting. I do not like going to the doctor, by all my experiences at the practice has been positive. Would like to see information about the PPG - Patient Participation Group in reception. Very disappointment I am y pain and only can get an appointment for 10 days after Better service quick appointment solve the problem , when you want to see the doctor is because you are not well All went to plan Nothing Very happy with the service, consultation I had at the surgery. The information displayed in reception is very useful, thank you for sharing. Pleasant and helpful doctor No This has to be the best run and well operated surgery in the country. No In trying to get a COVID jab somewhere other than in my arms, because I have lymphoedema risk in both arms, in London that’s not possible, as it seems in all pharmacies (which are administering the Covid jabs) they have not been trained to do so and hospitals don’t have the vaccine.  So my only option was the GP surgery and they refused to take steps to obtain a COVID jab for me. The surgery actually looking into obtaining a COVID jab for me instead of just refusing to help. Excellent treatment No Great  service  so helpful No I personally appreciate that my GP is bilingual so if I cannot find the right words in English  I know she will understand me No not that I can think\\nOf Good it\\'s  okey It\\'s  okey Very proficient and helpful Not really I like that it is good The following The appointment was quick and efficient Clear indications before and once at the surgery would have been welcomed The Practice as a whole are very  welcoming, friendly and helpful Quite happy with what exists.

NO Very good Okay thanks GP has very good services and Nurses too The clinic need improve services of Medicion Good service No thanks Good service No thanks Because they are kinds and professionals Nothing I am very satisfied with my GP Practice and would not change it for anything. I do not have any improvement suggestion at the moment. Love the surgery, have been there for 10 years, happy with my GPs and the nursing staff Staff at reception can be unfriendly and not very helpful at times. Kindness and professionality No Like the surgery a lot. More opportunity for screening like the new Atrial fibrillation screen being done by reception. courtesy and professionalism No Professional and polite all the staff Not Excellent service Perfect Perfect staff No Excellent caring and timing Na Extreme care and precision in treatment patients, and knowledge about their medical conditions and needs. Couldn’t be more better?! Just keep up the good work. The service is always prompt. No Good service,  you  don\\'t wait so long Friendly  people Very friendly and professional No Professional courteous and helpful staff Nothing I can think of NHS are very welcoming and have a friendly service Very understandable and have friendly workers Competence and kindness of staff No Always very helpful and, courteous Not sure Because they are looking after me every single things Keep it the same way There is no knowledge delivered or care Change my doctor the service is pants reception  staff smiling more instead of sitting looking unwelcoming at the front desk which hits you as soon as walk in makes u want ti turn around and go back out , not been able to hear  staff having private non work related conversations behind closed doors when its  your appointment time , seeing you at your booked appointment  time All team is always polite and helpful All great The standard of care, the friendly,welcoming and calm atmosphere combine to provide an example of just how good General Practice can be in the NHS.\\n, No. Clearly every member of the team treats us patients with respect and concern. I know that this is not always the case with other Surgeries and must be the result of hard work and a strong ethos. Good Don\\'t know Good surgery NO… Because the GP is very good with patients I would like to improve pharmacist s services Miss [PERSON] Better service I\\'ve was well treated. There\\'s nothing more, it\\'s a better surgery. Friendly service No Knowledgable doctors All good Very helpful No Always happy.

Gp is understanding and compassionate. The  reception staff  are courteous. And friendly and always try to help you every way they can. Due to the number of illnesses I suffer from some of which are serious, it would be so beneficial to me to have an appointment. much sooner based. Upon I am In a vulnerable group in relation to my medical problems. Good feeling Short time to appointment I was provided with the extra prescription because I was going away and my medicine would run out otherwise. I was told the wait for a new prescription was 2 days, in fact it was ready later the same day. It woukd be good to be sent a message when this is available so that the medicine can be picked up earlier. The lDoctors always take time to\\nListen to any  query and the support staff are friendly No All staff is caring and efficient No Both Dr [PERSON] and resident nurse are so nice, calm and comforting. Especially for someone with health anxiety, they’re both Godsend! None at all, going to the surgery feels like being home 💓 She took me seriously and warm staff. Nothing special. I think the surgery can do better with providing more appointments. Provide more appointmetns Rude staff Customer Service training for staff members No comment No comment Get on really well with my GP and the rest of the practice staff, I don\\'t have any complaints. I like the notice boards in reception very infomrative and give a  good overview of the practice Na I am ok Helpful staff and professional & helpful  GBs.

Absolutely not. The receptionists are very helpful, the same for the doctor and nursey No The doctors are friendly & only takes a few days to get an appointment. The reception & nursing staff are friendly & efficient too whixh makes a relaxing visit. No From a direct experience  over ten years plus I would recommend the doctors and nursing staff at the Earls Court Surgery Nothing that is of any great importance Dr [PERSON] is amazing, I feel I always get the best care, he takes times to listen and know what the problem is and shows the care and concern with the reassurance that am in safe hands. The appointments are always on time which are always a plus. I have never had to wait around or later. I would say just have more free emergency or free slots as I find to book an appointment with a specific dr takes a little longer then expected. The doctors and their staff are kind and helpful. Kindness and helpful attention and advice are the key. Very bad receptionists, no manners, very rude, unhelpful in every way Change all reception staff The treatment I got was fantastic No Very happy with my surgery no suggestion for improvement My husband and I have always received good service and good care from both the medical and admin team. Unable to think of any presently. Friendly and helpful No Because the stuff is very polite as my GP. My GP is professional, polite and warm person which is so important for all patients.

Everyone has been so kind and helpful. Because its a very good practise to a patient [PERSON] never had any problems Efficient,  expert and friendly appointment No The doctors are so patient centred , very professional & dedicated. As a patient they make you feel valued . No So efficient and friendly No Very engaged, empathetic, efficient and knowledgeable. No The people are just great Just carry on the good work Generally a very good practice I was disappointed not to see one of the familiar doctors. All staff and doctors are very good Keep up the good work Organised front desk Individuals at front desk should know who is working within the building. For example, the nutritionist & coach Very friendly place. Nearly every time I order a new prescription. I very carefully put all the details in my email and frequently a mistake is mad with for the instance the number of pills requested. Which means I have to send another request to your surgery and make another journey wasting your time and mine. However busy and overworked the whole team are they are exceptionally kin, caring, professional and efficient. I am thrillzd rhat my mzdical team is this practice. No Because it is the best practice in the area. The phone gets answered quickly and it is always possible to get an appointment if required. Not really . Staff are always helpful. Seen on time. Always pleasant. Efficient. No I got an appointment easily and the doctor was very thorough No Very short waiting time and excellent care. Not really as everything was as smooth as could have been wished I’ve been with his Practice for 25 years and I’ve always found them to be extremely helpful and kind and they always manage to get me in to see a doctor when I need to Nothing, I’m extremely happy Efficient excellent service No I feel comfortable speaking to doctors No Excellent reception. No Excellence.Efficient.Kind. No My doctor and everyone in the practice are competent and caring. no, can\\'t think of anything They have good staff They very accommodating Friendly reception & atmosphere in waiting area Blood sample went through to lab ok Very confident in the professional care and attention No Very nice people and a fist class service No I have found this GP practice consistently wonderful, kind, proactive, simply the best. No: always outstanding. It is an excellent  surgery No It is friendly and efficient and I feel heard and well looked after No Staff very welcoming. Doctor extremely thorough and interested in patient. No. Very impressed with the service. everyone is extremely kind and helpful and Dr [PERSON] ion particular no but i guess not having to go at all ( therefore one is well) I had an appalling experience, I was sent a text to book a smear testbevsyse I am 25 in June . On day of the test it was cancelled because the nurse was ill. The surgery phoned later on to say that I was too young to have the test anyway. I was very worried about having the test, and my Mother came on a 3 hour journey to be with me. Yes for the receptionist to know that you have to be 25 to do the test not 24 and for me to have been sent the text when I am 25! Staff are so friendly helpfull so nice Good service excellent Everything\\'s is fine, the control panel is working great too, many thx keep going in this way My husband and l have only been with the Chelsea Practice a short time, we have found everyone very pleasant and helpful. We feel that we are being well taken care of. Can\\'t think of anything. My husband and l have been with the Chelsea Practice for a short time and have found everyone very helpful. Can\\'t think of anything at the moment. Very Happy with my surgery and GPs, always helpful and friendly Nothing The doctors are really kind and helpful. The majority of the receptionist are lovely but I think some are a bit blunt The nurse was very polite It would have been better if the email sent to me by [PERSON] could have been communicated to the nurse and reception be more attentive as I clearly mentioned I had received an email regarding carer assessment. I have already sent an email regarding this . Thank you Dr.[PERSON] was calm, patient & thorough and the Surgery Team very helpful All excellent My baby was ill and you got her a same day appointment which was crucial have access to pediatricians at the surgery or be able to refer onto a ped The GP I spoke to was really knowledgeable and helpful. Nothing, keep going as you are!! I have never had to wait for more than a few days for an appointment, and if I need to be seen urgently I can arrange a same day appointment. The GPs are professional and kind, and most of all they listen. No. got appointment within a week , Portal is working well, Dr was as usual V informative and helpful nothing to add to my previous comments Staff are always unpleasant and rude Polite staff It’s far and away the best practice that we have ever known. We have a second home in the country and the complaints we hear about the local surgery are legion. No My appointment was booked for a few weeks and I received a communication by email as the person who sent that email was unaware i was already book. Then after a week received another email confirming that I could go ahead with my previous booking I think when receiving a text message there always a link to book appointment but it seems to me the calendar of the practice is not automatically updated. Some of the Doctors are wonderful such as Dr [PERSON] and Dr [PERSON] especially. There are others that I choose never to have anything to do with. My last visit was exactly as I hoped. [PERSON] especially is a kind, caring and supportive individual. Professional all round care delivered in with empathy and  compassion No I have been a patient for a very long time and have always been happy with the care and kindness  shown to my husband and me. I would have liked to have had a face to face consultation sooner than 14 days, but it was not urgent and I believe that had it been, a doctor would have seen me very quickly. you need to be treated by a neurologist, but it’s impossible to get to him No The doctors are incredible. They actually listen and take action. The reception staff are lovely and really helpful, and the nurses are amazing. No. Good facilities, helpful staff More appointment availability I am impressed by the service  thé kindness that I get every time I come or call No Too many patients already. I have  been a patient for over 50 years. I used to know my doctor- [PERSON] - and he knew me. Since he left I have seen countless numbers of doctors - all very good but no sense of familiarity with me or any of my conditions. Practice always efficient, but for this loyal 85-year old, detached and soulless. Would like to see at least one doctor more than once. No idea how that could possibly work any more. Sad. I have been with your practice for many years, as far back as Pelham Street and have always been happy - slightly perturbed because now very difficult to see or speak with Dr [PERSON] whose opinion I value very highly and in whom I have complete trust.  Having said that, I recently had a health check and was very happy with your new doctor [PERSON] - this was a very different experience from the last one I had which was conducted by someone who was unable to explain the results or answer any questions. I do understand that times are tough but the overall service I would rate as excellent from everyone.  Thank you all. Good and attentive service. This was a telephone appointment - perhaps I will ask to come in next time. The quality of care was excellent, and I was able to have a virtual appointment very quickly. The doctor was really professional and cared about my questions. No, it was perfect, thank you! Good doctor, nice premises, helpful staff Not having to wait so long to see my doctor Have been attached to the surgery for almost 40 years and have always been dealt with professional and caring manner. Seeing the same doctor might be a plus but not necessarily essential well attended waited a bit of a long time but acceptable Just brilliant No Always available over the phone and helpful. Good advice. Being able to meet face-to-face quicker Just polite and dynamic! No. Already 100% Reliable and efficient service More face to face appointments Good Doctors and practice team, good building and good systems, thank you. Well, turning back the clock, to happier times before Brexit, and the Wuhan Virus. i\\ni didn\\'t have to wait long, I am a long time patient of Dr [PERSON], and try to keep appointments to a minimum. But, if I need to see him, he is there. Now waiting for an appointment for a minor surgery, to be done by the Dr. No. Appointments are available relatively easily (often online booking). Advice is good. Prescriptions are easy to arrange online. No This was a telephone appointment only. It was helpful but as the technology did t allow me to upload a photo I needed to a visit in person would have been more satisfactory. However the doctor was helpful and arranged for me to have blood tests. In person on this occasion The G P\\'s specially Dr [PERSON] are outstanding No it was very satisfactory Many people I know are already patients No Very Professional support and help... Nope I have been going to this surgery for almost 30 years and have always received good service No There is very little empathy from your frontline staff who whilst being busy should acknowledge the patient and how long they have been registered at your Practice and not just been automatons in repeating if you want to speak to a Dr ring between. X and X.  People are human not robots Yes if it was easier to arrange an appointment either over the phone or face to face.  Currently it appears easier to go through the eye if a needle and I am not a camel. Not everyone should have to have a stopwatch on them during the call to make sure they are dead on time in order to get on the list of maybe speaking to a GP that day.  Also to be told it will be 2 weeks before you can speak to your specified GP is not acceptable especially if you are an elderly vulnerable patient who is scared and needs reassurance I have been a patient at this surgery for almost 20 years and have always been satisfied with the attention from the doctors or the wonderful nursing team Since Covid it does seem that you have to wait much longer for an appointment Some of the care I recetve is faultless and [PERSON] is a great support however i have no relationship with a doctor and if I need to see one they mainly look at their screnes ..i have had lost and confused blood and pee tests (NOTwhere [PERSON] is concerned ) and if I was a less perky nearly 92 year old with support from friends….I could have been in trouble . See above Because the very good surgery Don’t add more factor Very prepared and always available professionals No A lot of attention is given to every issue, easily available appointments in case of urgency No Always helpful, informative and helpful Not really The doctors are so good just wish the reception could get my prescriptions right! It is  good surgery Not having to answer surveys like the one - everybody is using them First class NHS surgery with brilliant doctors & nurses and very helpful admin staff. Nothing - superb in every respect - thank you, best [PERSON] Professional.  Prompt response.  On-time appointments. Immediate rather than prompt response. Always so professional and helpful all good thank you I am visiting surgery long time and I’m very happy Everything is good I’ve been a patient at this practice for decades and feel the staff have always done what they can to help. This last appointment I missed as I hadn’t realised appointments were now again in person. \\n\\nI regret that there isn’t a system of annual GP checkups, with clear notes that ensure continuity of care. Maintenance of health. \\n\\nFor people like me with ongoing health issues it’s not effective to have to explain anew each time. Also strangely difficult to retain an oversight of health changes when my observations are subjective, not objective. Good quality of care and appreciate the 9-11am urgent issues service. Shorter times to schedule appointments and less waiting in the surgery. The amazing care from the reception staff to all Doctors! No, I’m already pretty satisfied with the service Very clean, bright, comfortable environment. Pleasant people. Seen quickly. Dealt with efficiently. Excellent, no-fuss care. Not that I can think of. Good service No Professional,  friendly & helpful - in fact fantastic Keep going as is 👍👍👍 They are always there when I need them, especially when it comes to kids. No, I think I have the best experience with this GP surgery so far.. Prompt care, even when it is not possible to see or hear from my GP. Despite records being available to other doctors, they come in ‘cold’ . Consistency with own GP who knows the story  is invaluable and very different. Punctual appointment and very little delay between my call and being attended to. Pleasant service. No Professionalism The care my doctor took to listen to my concerns Pleasant doctors and friendly staff Face to face appointment rather than a telephone appointment Though more difficult to see the same GP that one likes nowadays I can say I was very satisfied with the GP I saw. At my last visit. I am satisfied tge way it works. The chap in reception is good as is another lady, there. Prompt, competent and efficient service No. All very satisfactory I left a poor practice & hoped the Stanhope practice would be better. I\\'m afraid many practices have issues & are not providing a good service to their patients Better communication Great advice, direction and service! Not really. I met Dr [PERSON]  at the surgery and following this a telephone call \\nShe listen my medical issues and prepared a plan of action \\nShe was very Professional in her care and advice to me I am having a follow up surgery appointment on the 22 February to discuss the process and my concerns Helpful friendly and quiet Working BMI weighing scales Efficient and reliable surgery No Very professional service and understanding doctors and nurses, who act quickly to resolve health matters. No I love them all No The level of service is good, and the staff is supportive and compassionate. They have embraced technology to make access easier. Reduce waiting times for in-person and remote appointments. The staff is very helpful and the doctors are great . Keep up the good work . Dr [PERSON] he is the best director I have seen very helpful [PERSON]e Dr [PERSON] is very sweet but appears alarmingly inexperienced and I was left wondering if she actually felt that confident in what she was doing - it was an unsettling experience. A more experienced confident practised doctor? Maybe? Partic given subject matter. Wheelchair accessibility  and prompt service No Helpful and assistance on health issues Many thanks Everything went smoothly & could not have been better No, as per preceding answer The neurse loula is ver cute and she makes me happy about her  interest for my healthy.\\nDr [PERSON] is fatestic oerdon regarding his manner and he is professional . The receptionist should be patient because twice she was rude with me. They are helpful, friendlyand efficient No Dr [PERSON] he is the best doctor I have seen very helpful [PERSON]e I am waiting to speak with a GP for an ongoing issue, I\\'m waiting and can\\'t get any answers. I was also called in but then they couldn\\'t do any tests for an admin issue. At the moment I\\'m not very happy Yes, getting help to address my issue Always pleasant and helpful at Reception.   On one occasion Dr. [PERSON] was my doctor and she was exceptionally kind and managed to arrange an urgent appointment at the hospital.\\nThank you very much. Doing the very best you can given the circumstances. Always very helpful No I feel the Drs are keen to help. Reception staff ( not all) need to be a little more polite, understanding and helpful. It mostly feels like taking an enquiry is tiresome. I\\'m still getting used to the new premises in two different locations.  I find it very difficult to speak to a receptionist by telephone as the waiting time is too long. Quicker response time to incoming calls.  I\\'ve tried using Patches as suggested to make an appointment and receive a message telling me to call the surgery to make an appointment ! Mostly efficient and quick response. No The staff in reception are friendly and welcoming and are efficient in confirming appointments by tNoext so thst the timetable runs smoothly. No the doctor I saw didn\\'t seem to have much confidence. I sat down for the blood test and she looked panicked about doing it saying I have very small veins and kept repeating that she doesn\\'t think she\\'ll be able to take blood.. its never been an issue before and hearing the doctor keep saying that and looking flustered isn\\'t exactly comforting.\\nRight after I had a cervical smear and was tense due to the whole interaction and the doctor\\'s confidence so I was having a hard time relaxing. Its not a pleasant experience on any given day and the fact that she kept saying stop tensing in an annoyed tone didn\\'t help.\\n\\nI left the appointment feeling super tense and was not able to do the blood test, I now have to spend another morning going to the hospital to get it done a calmer doctor I saw a very kind very understanding doctor Dr [PERSON] who was extremely helpful and put me at complete ease one thing on a negative note it takes me well over half an hour to talk to this surgery when I ring and today after waiting again over half an hour my call was hung up and I did not get to speak to the receptionist Yes making sure when I wait in line to be answered on the telephone that my call isn\\'t hung up when it is my turn Whenever I have to be in touch with Stanford Mews South medical centre either by phone or by attendance in person, everybody there (doctors, nurses and office staff) is unfailingly friendly. patient and helpful even though my demands are many and various, as might be expected at my age, now nearing 91. I am constantly telling friends and contacts how brilliantly I am being looked after. I even included the Centre in the acknowledgements section of my latest book that was published. The above says it all. Because your care is very efficient ands friendly. No You don\\'t see one doctor who knows you for long. You change doctors like clothes. I would have loved to see the same doctor every time l visit because they know your history or problems. Efficiency Waiting time is less Have been with the same surgery for last 40 years as pleased with their services Make appointment time quicker An efficient, friendly surgery. I miss the previous link between patient and particular doctor which certainly in my case proved beneficial, even life-saving. With the present surgery I find the turnover of doctors too great and disconcerting. Efficient excellent service No Earls Court Surgery is always accessible and responsive to all my queries. No; it was 100% People Kind, friendly and professional Nothing Administrative staff always very prompt and helpful and doctors also No Reception and desk help very efficient although obviously the the wait time is long due to your stressing work. However when we get through very courteous and good service No interview with the pressure under which you work p Helpful, friendly and caring medical surgery! Shorter time to wait for an appointment to see the Doctor you know-often too long to wait for his/her availability. It\\'s the bad experience I had with the lady at the front desk. My appointment was for 10am and I was there by 10:10 am she turned me away for 10 minutes late. I requested to talk to the nurse since it was my general check up. She said, she sent a email and no reply. She should have taking into account how far I came from and ask gone to ask the nurse if ican be seen but she was in a hurry to turn me away instead. And that was my first time at the 1a address for a check up. I think it was a very poor customer service experience I have ever had. It was an urgent response No Always get great help No I feel I can trust the knowledge and commitment of the staff The end of the telephone routine before the possibility of face to face Good service Not speaking to a bot for my referral consultation All the doctors are helpful and although one has to wait one can eventually speak to a doctor.    The nurse [PERSON] is excellent. Shorter waiting times for appointments. Professional Tea & biscuits My appointment with Dr. [PERSON] was very good and she was extremely empathetic and helpful. \\nHowever, list below the problems about the way the surgery is being run, which I hope will be taken seriously, as I know many other patients who have the same concerns.\\n\\nThe changes to the practice since before Covid have not been an improvement. The reception staff\\'s attitude has changed considerably and from a patient point of view not for the better.  There is no empathy and a reluctance to be constructively helpful, which verges on rudeness.\\nI have experienced finally getting through on the phone after waiting a long time, only to be told I am past the cutoff so have to call back at 2.00.   There ought to be a number reserved for people like me who care for an elderly person with dementia and who doesn\\'t know how the day will pan out - I can\\'t always be hanging on the phone at 8.30 in the morning or 2.00 pm.   My husband is 91, has vascular dementia and mobility problems.  \\n\\nRecently I witnessed one of your receptionists remark to a patient,  who arrived clearly in distress and  trying to see a doctor for an emergency appointment at 11.15, that she was too late and anyway would need to speak to a doctor on the phone before she could get a face to face.  The distressed lady who was having trouble with her breathing said that A&E had told her to come to her surgery if she experienced breathing trouble again. The receptionist offered no empathy or support - remember that A&E had instructed this lady to go to her GP.  All your receptionist could repeat to her was she would have to call on the phone at 2.00 for an appointment for an initial telephone triage with a doctor.  \\nThe receptionist then stated that a drop in surgery would be chaos, clearly she hadn\\'t been in the job very long because one of the main reasons we transferred to [PERSON]hope Mews West surgery from Redcliffe was precisely because there was a daily drop in surgery and it was never chaos.\\n\\nSee below my most recent incident at your surgery, as an illustration of the calibre and attitude of your reception staff.\\n\\nAt the beginning of January, I brought in a urine sample for my husband, having been instructed to do so on Christmas Eve by the out of hours doctor.  My husband actually spent Christmas day and Boxing day in the [PERSON] & Westminster with Covid as well as a UTI.  On discharge the [PERSON] & Westminster doctor also confirmed I should bring a sample to the surgery for follow up testing.  I brought in the sample and the lady at reception told me that she couldn\\'t help because I had no form and no doctor from the practice had requested the sample.  After much pleading she reluctantly agreed to contact a practice doctor for a form.  Why she couldn\\'t consult my husband\\'s records to see what had happened to him over Christmas, I do not know.   After nearly half an hour, another lady from reception asked her how she had contacted the doctor about my husband\\'s sample.  By email, came the reply.  The other lady then told her to message a doctor and came out to see me.  She apologised for the unhelpful attitude and said it shouldn\\'t have happened.  I nearly wrote to complain then but my life is complicated looking after my husband, so I didn\\'t.  This survey has given me the opportunity to air my grievances. The reception staff need to be more helpful Practitioner had no robe or equipment for modesty in preparation for my ECG . I was shocked! Yes… the practitioner should have  been provided with appropriate modesty gown and a small curtained off area for patients to undress and prepare themselves appropriately . He was apologetic . I did not go through with the appointment - wasting my time and his. I have re-booked with a female practitioner and in the event that she is not equipped appropriately I will have my own with me. The doctor who made my telephone appointment assured me that the practitioner was highly experienced and would have all the necessary equipment when I enquired about the issue of modesty.  \\nNot a good patient experience! I have been a patient of Stanhope Mews West for I think 30 years now, It is the best Doctors Surgery in the whole world. I have always been taken care of perfectly. The sraff are caring and wonderful and on this occasion Dr [PERSON] was exceptional in her care and called me twice afterwards. No Stanhope Mews West is already pefect. I feel that you are never able to get a regular GP, and often the appointments are so scarce it\\'s hard not to have to choose the earliest. I think the GPs in general need to listen a little better to the concerns of the patient The light in the building, sets the tone lightness, professional and care No I was very satisfied Friendly and efficient and great advice No everything was seen to during the appointment I was assisted well I am very much happy and always thankful for their good service. I have not had a recent appointmen but I thought I would answer anyway. My experience is that when I need a doctor, I find it hard to get an appointment unless urgent,  I need to have a telephone consultation first.\\n I was once told, I think it was for a persistent and annoying cough that I had had for months after a laryngitis and I wanted to know if there was a cough medicine I could take. .I was told I should go to A and E but it was not THAT urgent, I just needed advice. I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP. She saw me the day afterwards, scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription.  \\nAlso, some friends of my age, (we are all oldies) get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests, sometimes asked for by my cardiologist, sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by.\\n  \\nI am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody, patients and doctors from many points of view and my \"problems\" are minor compared to others. However, as a result   I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist. My check ups for a suspicious mole (on my back, I live alone and have no way to check this myself) were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen, on consultant\\'s advice \"in three months\". Admittedly, this was not the GP, it was the hospital. Now I would be happy to see the GP for regular check ups rather than going to the private consultations.\\n\\nSo, it would be useful to have a regular check up, that is my point.\\n\\nI have been seen by different doctors, not often and they were very nice and one in particular was helpful getting me quick appointments for my thyroid \"problem\". \\nI have been impressed with the notices I receive for vaccinations and general information, like recently, when I was given a possibility to be checked for atrial fibrillation. I would have come but was out of the country!\\nThe staff at the reception is always helpful and kind. I think maybe, that the distinction in \"urgent\" and \"non urgent\"  can be off putting when one just maybe needs reassurance or advice and does want to wait two weeks to talk to a doctor. What is considered urgent? It is really all relative and especially when one is older and lives alone.  Maybe I was unlucky  but now I hesitate calling. \\nThank you for giving me the opportunity to express my experience. I know I need to be thankful that I have access to care at all! I spent less than 10 minutes with the Doctor. I had 3 easy questions and on the 3rd question the Doctor says to me “this will have to be your last question.” I had not taken much of her time and yet she seemed annoyed by the amount of enquiry i put forth. She mentioned that her prior patients had asked too many questions. Later i thought, no wonder people are asking so many questions - it’s so difficult to get an appointment to see a doctor. -  i wasn’t there is a limit to how many questions a patient is permitted  to ask. Maybe she was just having a bad day? In which case i understand because , it happens. The NHS and Doctors are under tremendous strain so i appreciate the fact that i was able to receive help. I guess i just wanted to feel like the Doctor realised how much we patients appreciate them. Instead i got the impression i had somehow annoyed her. Again though, we all have bad days so it’s ok. Easy to book an appointment and availability of it. Quickly answer phone, friendly staff. Cleaness Appointment on time , [PERSON] very quick for actions No [PERSON]tanhope mews surgery is very well organised. [PERSON]taff are able to refer to records and offer appointments promptly. Good follow-up with email reminders. Telephone consultation with Doctor [PERSON]. was prompt and complete. No. The surgery clearly has too many patients. Getting any appointment has been so difficult that I have had to go private. Despite the fact that I’m one of the highest tax payers in this country I have limited access to my GP! I think it’s absolutely appalling that patients have to wait over a week sometimes to get an appointment and then that appointment is solely over the telephone. You can’t diagnose chest infections over the phone. Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs, hips and groin and was not seem at all. Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers. She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would. Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs. I miss the old surgery when there was a walk-in for more urgent enquiries, and there was better client care. Frankly this surgery should not be taking on any more patients because it is incapable of taking care of the patients it does have! See above The reception person did not acknowledge my presence so I waited until she was ready to communicate. At that point I’d expect a greeting and perhaps recognition I hadn’t interrupted her computer interaction. Not forthcoming. As this was my first visit to this site,  I was directed to wait but had to ask where. Fortunately I wasn’t presenting in a stressed mind frame, but this is a communication failure similar to what I remembered from the previous premises in SW10, so not promising. In my consultation there was a primary health care worker who communicated appropriately but also a second female whose presence went completely unexplained and who failed to communicate at all. What was she doing there and who should have introduced her / explained her presence ? Basically, customer communication remains poor at the surgery. I was already thinking of looking elsewhere and that instinct hasn’t changed. 20 years as a patient (previously The Redcliffe Surgery)Both my wife and II have always been very satisfied with the care and attention. Less holding time on the telephone. More opportunity for face-to-face consultation. Closer doctor/patient relationship. I found a positive experience No I was happy The appointment lasted about 5 minutes , so it would have been a better use of  everyone’s time to have included more tests - especially as l am going back again this week for a health check . An estimate of the length of the appointment . clear and friendly No It is a very caring practice Everything was fine I have a good rapport with my clinic nurse and have recently received increasing support and cooperation in dealing with my health from both the nurse and doctors. It would have been better if the present level of support had materialised earlier but the pandemic created havoc. I never get enough of items for my diabetes treatment. I have to beg for more things. I cannot speak to pharmacist at all. Change the GP Despite the consultant and GP recommending me to have a smear test, the practitioner carrying out the test didn’t think I should be having one and made me feel very awkward and uncomfortable about it, even after me explaining that the consultant and doctor had put me forward for it. I won’t see the same practitioner ever again and that might help in the future. I receive very good care at Stanhope Mews West. No question is too small to ask. The doctors are very caring and thoughtful. Not just I, my whole family is looked after very well. The phones are sometimes busy, it would be great to an operator quicker when I call, although, there is a very convenient online systems to book appointments and I call in very rarely. I have been with the surgery for many years now and found that doctors, nurses and staff are very competent and always helpful. In some instances reception staff over the phone can be a little rushed, but it is understandable due to the volume of calls Very professional and helpful staff. Usually easy to get an appointment Nothing comes to mind Very friendly environment No Everything was done very professionally and really well done. All the people are extremely nice. It is a very easy and good surgery to be with. No! I find the doctors are serious - when one gets an appointment. I had a v positive experience on last two appts - Dr [PERSON], Dr [PERSON]. I value the ancillary services being on surgery premises. I am a regular user of physio ([PERSON]) and podology ([PERSON] Concern). less waiting time for appointments, less hassled receptionists- though I think there has been an improvvement in last few months Professional doctors &  staff I am very happy with the surgery I didn\\'t  have to wait  to long to be see bh the Doctor So far in the  time that I\\'m visiting  these centre , I being  haven  a good  service.  I don\\'t  have to complain  for anything  . Thank  you  . I am happy with Dr.[PERSON] but I have problem with Farmasist . Yes,Improvment services of farmsist I am happy with Dr. [PERSON] and not happy with [PERSON]. You need to Improv services of Farmsist and respect the customers . Efficient, friendly and polite No Everyone is very helpful and friendly Not really Receptive, efficient polite. Automatics repeat prescription capabilities Prompt, efficient, knowledgeable, and caring medical advice and treatment. I can think of nothing. Very professional and efficient. A pleasure to interact with. All in all , a absolutely first class. No Because was good service No That’s my opinions If the patient is really needs to be seen especially old people the vulnerable they should prioritise them to be seen not let them wait then comeback , thanks Always very helpful No No waiting, and everybody helpful and charming. No Friendly and very helpful No Responsible doctors No Very helpful No Because its a good surgery. Not really The staff is very welcoming and the nurses first class No The doctors and staff are really lovely Sometimes one needs a follow up. Excellent service! Nope It’s a very efficient practice. Not really . Service is very straight forward and efficient No Great doctors and good reception Easier to make appointment ie not restricted to having to call back at 2pm Because you have looked after me brilliantly for over 20 years Not that I can think of All staff are helpful, patient. The Doctors explain issues clearly. The surroundings are calming No Appointment was late and nurse was ill prepared On time and fully prepared to do blood pressure reading Easy to get appointments No Eiificent, expert and friendly No Service excellent, front desk delightful. Best practice I’ve ever been to Nope Staff very kind and helpful. No I always feel well attended, that time and thought has been put into meeting my needs, everyone in reception always explains things really clearly It would be convenient to book a GP appointment online, but I understand the need to filter callers to best serve the urgent needs Excellent service. Dr [PERSON] is great No I find Dr [PERSON] very empathetic when it comes to the health issues I have been experiencing I feel she and the team at the practice have been both kind and helpful in helping/supporting me Prompt seevice and caring No Excellent service No Good No Efficient service and nice doctor Not really All the staff arekind, professional and efficient. No Always prompt and helpful No I have great docter Good relation with them Because I have always been treated with respect and dignity at all times by all members of staff No for me everything is just right Excellent GP and service. No A helpful practice. No Excellent practice with very professional doctors and staff No I\\'m still waiting for my ultrasound appointment, and also been told by the doctor that I only have 10 minutes.\\nThis is not caring it is more like a machinery. Yes I feel extremely lucky to be registered at this surgery. The wait times for appointments are reasonable, the staff are friendly and efficient, the doctors and nurse are excellent. Nothing I could think of. They provide excellent service I am happy with the Chelsea Practice as it is Very helpful team Please still the same as you are Very helpful staff No They are very efficient and pleasant although overworked. Not really. Amazing doctors - very nice friendly reception Not a thing The Reception staff are always helpful. The Doctors mostly caring, helpful & attentive. It would seem that only sometimes & say only one out of 10 appointments the Dr\\'s do not have enough time to listen to more than one problem. This can be unsettling for the elderly with several issues. Prompt and friendly service, all done on schedule. Overall a very good experience. No. Excellent dictirs  they listen and give you advise. Receltion very helpful Not too much. It’s a friendly, efficient practice No because I think they are always excellent Efficiency, care and attention Not that I can think about…..So far, so good Very polite and always helpful or at least willing to help. Not really, all efforts are made to accommodate enquiries. Perhaps if there was more phone lines available, that would help with waiting to speak with a receptionist. Very good drs and staff. No Very good doctors My experience is very good, Surgery and doctors, I like them Very friendly and welcoming and good No A friendly team with very later appointments 😊 My wife is pregnant of 28 weeks, but they could not arrange any appointment for us in 3 weeks. They should be a bit serious if there is sensitive patients like mine. I got appointments after 3 weeks. The practice staff are always responsive No It is my health center and they always take good care of me. Yes... A lot, I have learned to deal with my illness, with peace of mind and exercises.... In the hospital and GP they are like my family , los doctores son buenos profesionales 👌👍👍👍 Generally good however there often seems to be confusion over prescriptions Trying to make appointments by telephone - often you will end up in quite a length queue which means that you have to retry several times The doctors I request to see are always attentive and very professional. No I did not have a consultation with a GP, but the nurse at Stanhope Mews West manages my anticoagulation treatment. I undertake my own blood tests, on a schedule set by the nurse and, based on the results I report, the nurse controls the Warfarin dosage. The service she provides is excellent, always sending me the new dosage and test date on the same day that I report my INR test result. Nothing about the service needs to be improved. Dr [PERSON] is always welcoming, incisive, friendly and careful.  Highly recommend her. No The practice inspires confidence. I don’t think so Always I get the answer for my question and illness problems. More time for GP… and more options for sorting health issues All the doctors I meet with are very knowledgeable, sympathetic and attentive. No Helpful and thorough information, seemed to genuinely care and sent helpful follow up info Being able to respond to the GP’s text quickly with a response Very friendly staff! Unfortunately tech is not always the best - ex. printer broken and no way to send to print toi reception - but the team makes up for it. Very friendly staff! Unfortunately tech is not always the best - ex. printer broken and no way to send to print toi reception - but the team makes up for it. Dr [PERSON] was kind, attentive and knowledgeable. She had even read an article relating to germs in the Thames - and discussed it with me when we discussed the possible bug I had. \\nShe had seen my name on the follow up appointment list and requested she saw me again\\nSo often these days surgeries have an array for doctors who treat everyone the same and the personal caring touch has gone. This is not the  case with Dr [PERSON]. More Doctors like [PERSON]. Make it possible to differentiate better between very urgent and less urgent, and not urgent appointments - because with a 2 week wait for ‘non urgent’ appointments - people are inclined to say their appointment is urgent. I have experienced very good care with Dr [PERSON]/[PERSON]  and previously Dr [PERSON] and have good relationship with staff members No as per above … though I have noticed some of the new receptionists ( possibly on trial) have  seemed  very abrupt and detached … as though job was a bind ! Superb service. Very knowledgeable doctor with excellent patient interaction No As good as the surgery has been. They is room for improvement. Particularly in seeing same doctors. The standard I feel has fallen in recent years since the pandemic. For doctors to carry out more face to face appointments. Also to try and keep seeing the same doctor is more difficult than prior to covid. I’m sure as to why doctors seem reluctant to see patients face to face more often Everyone is friendly and I get a quick response to my queries No Lovely  nurses. No,also helpful receptionists Doctor [PERSON] was thorough and explained everything clearly. Professional service. Nothing Kind and professional service Earlier date of the appointment would have been appreciated Everyone is helpful, kind, polite and informative chocolate! Easy to book (non emergency) and good service. Didn’t feel rushed. Felt important. First appointment with the nurse was late which made me worry I may be late for my subsequent appointment with the doctor. Perhaps an indication of how late appointments are running would have saved the worry I would like to see the GP in person and not speak over the phone , that’s not a real GP to then I self diagnose myself in that case. Sadly, the health care  is getting worse in this country. Very impersonal. Very disappointed as I never really need a GP. See in the doctor / GP in person so he/ she could actually see my swollen lymph. The front desk staff are dedicated and so good at their job I can’t speak more highly about the service they provide and some of the doctors, including Doctor [PERSON], who is currently with the practice, have been admirable.  However there is no consistency and no follow through.  After being referred to a specialist department for further investigation, the box is ticked and the patient is cast adrift and left to sink or swim, because unless they make a fuss and pester the practice after the referral, they are not contacted again.  Half the problem is that the doctors are never in the practice for any length of time. Just as the patient gets to know a doctor and more Importantly the doctor gets to know the patient and take an interest in them,  the doctor is moved on and the patient has lost the invaluable link with someone who is familiar with their medical history - it is just a conveyor belt of people on the move and the insight and help a doctor can provide through personal knowledge of the patient is lost. The thing is, not all practices are like this.  Friends in Forest Gate, with a tremendous diversity of patients from all over the world where a team of interpreters is on standby, tell me the NHS treatment they receive from their local GP Practice is outstanding and very personal with patients being rung by doctors to see how they are doing and same day appointments are nearly always available. No, the telephone appointment with Dr [PERSON] was constructive and helpful for me. Excellent practice with helpful and nice front desk staff No It took over a month to make the appointment for a 24 hour blood pressure monitor as there were no available appointments before. I asked over the phone for more details about how to use the device and none were given. I was not sent an information document nor referred to somewhere I could find more information. I was not told what to wear. I was told to continue doing everything normally which is not the case. If you are walking when it goes off or stretching your arm is reads an error and retakes the reading 1-2 minutes later. This basic information could have been provided to me. In the end I googled how to use it and found and information leaflet from another UK practice and followed their guidelines. All in all I would suggest you look into providing patients with more information about what to wear, not being able to shower while it is on, not being able to change clothes and also how to use the machine and that it keeps you awake all night as it goes off every hour so be prepared to be really tired the day after. All of this information is required and needs to be provided. Even just a link or QR code to an online document with all the details would be great. When I handed the machine back after the 24 hours I was given no further information regarding the results, who would be contacting me, if anyone is contacting me!, how they will contact me etc. More information, more clear instructions, more follow up information Your GP\\'s say they will follow up but never do! I have been trying with both GP and Cardiologist to get a replacement for Hydrochlorthiazide 25mg tablet, that your pharmacist will no longer prescribe as it costs the NHS too much money, since around September 2023. It is now 29 February 2024; after repeated calls, messages, in person requests at surgery from myself and with just two weeks remaining of the aforementioned  tablet and NO WORD FROM EITHER GP OR CARDIOLOGIST as to which replacement tablet I should be on. Certain reception staff members showing they are overwhelmed and therefore showing their stress through being annoyed with patient. This is subtle but clearly visible. Also reception staff members that overindulge time waster patients when there is a long queue and only one receptionist. Quick, kept informed once the booking app gets updated Revise the booking app Things are not what they used to be. No comment!.. I miss the walk in clinic and ideally it would nice to have one dedicated doctor instead of seeing a different one each time as above Friendly and personal approach To receive test results directly by email The service was quick, efficient and it worked! It was a skin infection -- I would have liked to receive better advice on how to care for the wound while it was healing. I live in Earl’s court. It took me a while to get in Chelsea. The nurse measured my blood pressure(which I do daily at home). She said I had to review the medicines with pharmacist. I went back to the reception and the receptionist in an upset way asked my I had to see the pharmacist. I explained the reasons and he said the pharmacist was not able to see me\\n And she would phone me the day after. Perhaps before taking an appointment you should check if your employees are available. On top of this, the day after the pharmacist said that the medicine I am taking is not available in the UK so she cancelled my current prescription and closed the call. I really struggle to believe that she could not prescribe any sort of other medicines from the sartan family. Overall the clinic is not providing a good service. Now I understand why many doctors/nurses just call patients. In my case it would have been better and would have not wasted my time Generally, it\\'s a good service. Yes, I was booked for a smear test and a general health check up. I received a phone call a day before to say I should do both with the same nurse, not as two different appointments as had been arranged. When I got there, the nurse said she couldn\\'t do the general health check up as that is done by someone else who has a specific machine. She suggested I phone the reception and make an appointment for next week. I explained that I\\'m away in Lincoln next week and for the remainder of the month, and at the end of the month, I\\'m working in Italy until July - which is why I wanted to get all of this done this week. The nurse said there was nothing she could do (which was probably true). She did the smear test, and did take my bloods. I shouldn\\'t have been told that the nurse could do all when she couldn\\'t, clearly. I will now have to wait until July before I can have a check up. The doctor I spoke to on Monday when I first called immediately y suggested anti viral for what I thought might have been shingles. I started them within 72 hours. It appears now I might have had herpes simplex so the solution was still relevant No Serious following of the gp who is calling back and cautious in his diag ordering blood test to check your health condition and quick to give you the medication you need.\\nNurses very human and nice\\nReception desk welcome the patients The Problem is when something happens during week ends..... I don\\'t have  a trusted doctor or nurse to recommend to a friend as they always change. I received a text message for an appointment at the centre in the next 45 minutes. I rushed with my child to the clinic, only to hear it was a telephone appointment! Better communication next time please. Quick urgent appointment was given to me . Perfect , thank you Excellent service very nice staff Not having to wait such a long time for the surgery to answer the initial telephone call The reception staff were very friendly and  efficient. My doctor was caring and we talked about my interest in horse riding with reference to the injury I had.  The doctor  treated me without  an age unconscious bias which often happens as a women in my late fifties. She was attentive and bright. I felt assured and uplifted . No ! Immediate response within 15 mins through phone, text and same day appointment. Really made me feel hopeful and I am absolutely happy with the support and examination performed by Dr [PERSON]. So far I\\'m very happy Reliable medical care and for speedy appointments.  We are very luck to get such great service in London, in comparison to areas of London where it takes weeks to get an appointment or consultation. Not that I can think of. Efficient friendly service No it was all good my experience has been quite good after many decades with the surgery it would be nice to have a regular doctor to consult I like the calmness of the surgery. Being assured of seeing the same Doctor For my husband and I it is more difficult to get to than the Radcliffe surgery old place.  Also I have waited quite a long time for the phone to be answered. If possible I would like to have the continuity of seeing the same doctor. Great service this time More face to face visits Good in clinic facilities and service Telephone response times I am extremely confused.. Do tots keep moving and I have become an object. There is no human element left and seems humanity has gone . No yes GPs should be committed for a period of few years so a patient can have a choice too. Not all on their terms. We pay tax for them as well to attend to our needs. My GP is a professional one with a knowledge and empathy. Other people are also helpful and nice. The communication could occasionally be a better. I don\\'t dare to ask for a quicker access to the services under the circumstances. Very friendly Maybe have more appointments I’m happy with the services No Professional. Don\\'t know how to directly contact doctor'"

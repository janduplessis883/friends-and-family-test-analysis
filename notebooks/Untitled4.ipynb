    "### Paraphrase Mining \n",
    "Here's how paraphrase mining could enhance your exploration of theme extraction and trend analysis in the context of GP surgery reviews:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Theme Extraction**: By using paraphrase mining, you can group together reviews that essentially say the same thing but in different words. For example, \"The receptionist was very welcoming\" and \"Great service at the front desk\" could be identified as expressing a similar sentiment about staff behavior. This can help you consolidate feedback more accurately, ensuring that your thematic analysis captures the true frequency and nature of the comments on specific aspects like wait times, staff attitudes, or cleanliness.\n",
    "2. **Refined Trend Analysis**: Paraphrase mining can also improve trend analysis. When you track changes over time, it's crucial to recognize when different phrases are expressing similar sentiments. This ensures that your analysis accounts for all relevant data points, providing a more accurate and nuanced understanding of how patient perceptions evolve. For instance, changes in sentiment about a new online booking system might be expressed in various ways across reviews. Paraphrase mining helps you aggregate these diverse expressions to assess the overall trend more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To delve deeper into these topics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment with Tools**: There are various NLP libraries and tools that support sentence transformers and paraphrase mining, such as Hugging Face's Transformers library. You could experiment with these tools using actual review data to get hands-on experience.\n",
    "2. **Case Studies**: Look for case studies or research papers where sentence transformers and paraphrase mining have been applied to similar types of text analysis. This can provide insights into methodologies and outcomes that might inform your approach.\n",
    "3. **Project Implementation**: Consider a pilot project where you apply these techniques to a subset of your review data. Start with theme extraction to identify major themes and then perform trend analysis to see how perceptions in these themes change over time. This project could serve as a practical learning experience and a proof of concept for wider application in your practice.\n"

The reception staff's attitude has changed considerably and from a patient point of view not for the better.  There is no empathy and a reluctance to be constructively helpful, which verges on rudeness.\\nI have experienced finally getting through on the phone after waiting a long time, only to be told I am past the cutoff so have to call back at 2.00.   There ought to be a number reserved for people like me who care for an elderly person with dementia and who doesn't know how the day will pan out - I can't always be hanging on the phone at 8.30 in the morning or 2.00 pm.   My husband is 91, has vascular dementia and mobility problems.  \\n\\nRecently I witnessed one of your receptionists remark to a patient,  who arrived clearly in distress and  trying to see a doctor for an emergency appointment at 11.15, that she was too late and anyway would need to speak to a doctor on the phone before she could get a face to face.  The distressed lady who was having trouble with her breathing said that A&E had told her to come to her surgery if she experienced breathing trouble again. The receptionist offered no empathy or support - remember that A&E had instructed this lady to go to her GP.  All your receptionist could repeat to her was she would have to call on the phone at 2.00 for an appointment for an initial telephone triage with a doctor.  \\nThe receptionist then stated that a drop in surgery would be chaos, clearly she hadn't been in the job very long because one of the main reasons we transferred to [PERSON]hope Mews West surgery from Redcliffe was precisely because there was a daily drop in surgery and it was never chaos.\\n\\nSee below my most recent incident at your surgery, as an illustration of the calibre and attitude of your reception staff.\\n\\nAt the beginning of January, I brought in a urine sample for my husband, having been instructed to do so on Christmas Eve by the out of hours doctor.  My husband actually spent Christmas day and Boxing day in the [PERSON] & Westminster with Covid as well as a UTI.  On discharge the [PERSON] & Westminster doctor also confirmed I should bring a sample to the surgery for follow up testing.  I brought in the sample and the lady at reception told me that she couldn't help because I had no form and no doctor from the practice had requested the sample.  After much pleading she reluctantly agreed to contact a practice doctor for a form.  Why she couldn't consult my husband's records to see what had happened to him over Christmas, I do not know.   After nearly half an hour, another lady from reception asked her how she had contacted the doctor about my husband's sample.  By email, came the reply.  The other lady then told her to message a doctor and came out to see me.  She apologised for the unhelpful attitude and said it shouldn't have happened.  I nearly wrote to complain then but my life is complicated looking after my husband, so I didn't.  This survey has given me the opportunity to air my grievances.\\n\\n\",\n",

I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP. She saw me the day afterwards, scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription.  \\nAlso, some friends of my age, (we are all oldies) get check ups by their GP but so far I have had to ask for blood tests, sometimes asked for by my cardiologist, sometimes because I felt a long time had gone by.\\n  \\nI am aware that COVID has been very detrimental for everybody, patients and doctors from many points of view and my \"problems\" are minor compared to others. However, as a result   I am stuck seeing a private dermatologist. My check ups for a suspicious mole (on my back, I live alone and have no way to check this myself) were continuously cancelled or postponed but I needed it to be seen, on consultant\\'s advice \"in three months\".

Despite the fact that I’m one of the highest tax payers in this country I have limited access to my GP! I think it’s absolutely appalling that patients have to wait over a week sometimes to get an appointment and then that appointment is solely over the telephone. You can’t diagnose chest infections over the phone. Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs, hips and groin and was not seem at all. Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers. She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would. Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs. I miss the old surgery when there was a walk-in for more urgent enquiries, and there was better client care. Frankly this surgery should not be taking on any more patients because it is incapable of taking care of the patients it does have! ',\n",

Fortunately I wasn’t presenting in a stressed mind frame, but this is a communication failure similar to what I remembered from the previous premises in SW10, so not promising. ',\n",

If you do get an appointment it’s on the phone, then the Dr gets you to come in anyway… It’s double the time spent on an issue cos the reception staff on the phone flat out refuse to let you bypass the pointless phone calls. Huge changes are needed at this surgery, it’s an utter disgrace! The Drs are Extremely likely if you ever get to see one. The reception staff are extremely obstructive and devoid of common sense. They live and die by what the computer tells them. I understand that the Tories have defunded the NHS massively, but the reception staff could at least try a little to help more.

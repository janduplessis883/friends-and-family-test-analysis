There ought to be a number reserved for people like me who care for an elderly person with dementia and who doesn't know how the day will pan out - I can't always be hanging on the phone at 8.30 in the morning or 2.00 pm.   My husband is 91, has vascular dementia and mobility problems.  \n",

The distressed lady who was having trouble with her breathing said that A&E had told her to come to her surgery if she experienced breathing trouble again. The receptionist offered no empathy or support - remember that A&E had instructed this lady to go to her GP.  All your receptionist could repeat to her was she would have to call on the phone at 2.00 for an appointment for an initial telephone triage with a doctor.  \n",
      "The receptionist then stated that a drop in surgery would be chaos, clearly she hadn't been in the job very long because one of the main reasons we transferred to PERSON]hope Mews West surgery from Redcliffe was precisely because there was a daily drop in surgery and it was never chaos.\n",

      "At the beginning of January, I brought in a urine sample for my husband, having been instructed to do so on Christmas Eve by the out of hours doctor.  My husband actually spent Christmas day and Boxing day in the PERSON] & Westminster with Covid as well as a UTI.  On discharge the PERSON] & Westminster doctor also confirmed I should bring a sample to the surgery for follow up testing.  I brought in the sample and the lady at reception told me that she couldn't help because I had no form and no doctor from the practice had requested the sample.  After much pleading she reluctantly agreed to contact a practice doctor for a form.  Why she couldn't consult my husband's records to see what had happened to him over Christmas, I do not know.   After nearly half an hour, another lady from reception asked her how she had contacted the doctor about my husband's sample.  By email, came the reply.  The other lady then told her to message a doctor and came out to see me.  She apologised for the unhelpful attitude and said it shouldn't have happened.  I nearly wrote to complain then but my life is complicated looking after my husband, so I didn't.  This survey has given me the opportunity to air my grievances.\n",

I was quite disappointed and then went to a private GP. She saw me the day afterwards, scheduled a chest Xray and got me a prescription.  \n",

I had 3 easy questions and on the 3rd question the Doctor says to me “this will have to be your last question.” I had not taken much of her time and yet she seemed annoyed by the amount of enquiry i put forth. She mentioned that her prior patients had asked too many questions. Later i thought, no wonder people are asking so many questions - it’s so difficult to get an appointment to see a doctor. -  i wasn’t there is a limit to how many questions a patient is permitted  to ask. Maybe she was just having a bad day? In which case i understand because , it happens. \n",

      "The surgery clearly has too many patients. Getting any appointment has been so difficult that I have had to go private. Despite the fact that I’m one of the highest tax payers in this country I have limited access to my GP! I think it’s absolutely appalling that patients have to wait over a week sometimes to get an appointment and then that appointment is solely over the telephone. You can’t diagnose chest infections over the phone. Plus my mother has really been suffering for over a year with pain in her legs, hips and groin and was not seem at all. Instead she was sent off to some physio to get some exercise pointers. She was only given one session and no one has bothered to follow up despite saying they would. Plus the surgery focuses its attention on all the wrong things simply to fulfil government mandates rather than actually take care of patient needs. I miss the old surgery when there was a walk-in for more urgent enquiries, and there was better client care. Frankly this surgery should not be taking on any more patients because it is incapable of taking care of the patients it does have! \n",
      "The reception person did not acknowledge my presence so I waited until she was ready to communicate. At that point I’d expect a greeting and perhaps recognition I hadn’t interrupted her computer interaction. Not forthcoming. As this was my first visit to this site,  I was directed to wait but had to ask where. Fortunately I wasn’t presenting in a stressed mind frame, but this is a communication failure similar to what I remembered from the previous premises in SW10, so not promising. \n",

The doctors take everything lightly and they don’t even check your symptoms, refuse to make referrals to the NHS and suggest to go privately. Sometimes i wait 2-3months before seeing my GP as I know the answer will always be “you have nothing so don’t worry” by only looking my face. \n",

The speed with which Dr PERSON] effected my transfer made it posdible for me be urgently seen very quickly by a top cancer consultant and rapidly undergo  blood tests,MRI and PET, scans quickly followed up with intense chemotherapy, which enabled me to then go onto chemoradiotherapy and I am now on immunology trials.

Perhaps an NHS-wide issue is inter-site/department communication between specialist hospital provision and surgery monitoring, resulting in duplication of procedures such as blood pressure and other function tests.

Only being able to call at 8am is unfair. I have a very stressful and busy job and 8am is when I need to commute. I either lose my job or suffer health problems as you dare not ring at any other time or reception will snap at you and tell you the next non emergency appointment is in 2026. If you do get an appointment it’s on the phone, then the Dr gets you to come in anyway… It’s double the time spent on an issue cos the reception staff on the phone flat out refuse to let you bypass the pointless phone calls. Huge changes are needed at this surgery, it’s an utter disgrace! The Drs are Extremely likely if you ever get to see one. The reception staff are extremely obstructive and devoid of common sense. They live and die by what the computer tells them. I understand that the Tories have defunded the NHS massively, but the reception staff could at least try a little to help more. I’m sick to the teeth of paying an outrageous amount in tax that pays your staffs wages to be treated like crap and never get a Drs appointment. I have gone private multiple times over the last few years cos of how bad this survey is. Shame on you all. \n",

However there is no consistency and no follow through.  After being referred to a specialist department for further investigation, the box is ticked and the patient is cast adrift and left to sink or swim, because unless they make a fuss and pester the practice after the referral, they are not contacted again.  Half the problem is that the doctors are never in the practice for any length of time. Just as the patient gets to know a doctor and more Importantly the doctor gets to know the patient and take an interest in them,  the doctor is moved on and the patient has lost the invaluable link with someone who is familiar with their medical history - it is just a conveyor belt of people on the move and the insight and help a doctor can provide through personal knowledge of the patient is lost.

I was not told what to wear. I was told to continue doing everything normally which is not the case. If you are walking when it goes off or stretching your arm is reads an error and retakes the reading 1-2 minutes later. This basic information could have been provided to me. In the end I googled how to use it and found and information leaflet from another UK practice and followed their guidelines. All in all I would suggest you look into providing patients with more information about what to wear, not being able to shower while it is on, not being able to change clothes and also how to use the machine and that it keeps you awake all night as it goes off every hour so be prepared to be really tired the day after. All of this information is required and needs to be provided. Even just a link or QR code to an online document with all the details would be great.

I was given a phone appointment which is ok however as I have never been to the practice nor ever been to a gp in the uk I was expecting to have an in person appointment. I was lucky to get a same day phone appointment. The problems started while on the phone to the gp, stated they don’t often prescribe the medication I am usually on, but could give be a months dose and gave me a list of alternative medications. My concern is that this medication is an antidepressants that I have been stable on for 5 years. From my understanding the practice and gps do not want to prescribe me the medication as it cost the practice more than alternatives which have not worked for me the past. The gp is putting their need/ wants ahead of the patient that they are meant to be caring for. If the practice refuses to continue to prescribe this medication for me I will have to look into a private go which as a nurse working in the nhs is not an sustainable option for me\n",

Appointment calendars only look 2 weeks ahead and get fully booked up, so I get told to ring back in a week - that is insane. I get sent appointments for things I never asked for (eg tests) at times I can't make, but no means of referring back, so the time just gets wasted. I get sent appointments for things I do want at times that suit you, but not me, so even more time is wasted.

I want it to work at ANY CHEMIST and not the one on the top, as this restricts where I can go, and the chemist many not have the type of pills I want.

In particular I have had a lot of help from practice nurses and pharmacists associated with the practice, and the system for vaccinations etc during lockdown was excellent. The only thing I have noticed is that the recording systems for blood pressure readings don't always link up - so I have sent readings as requested by, I think, the NHS more centrally, which haven't registered with the surgery - but staff are very helpful and sort it out quickly.

      "PERSON] is the best, she was extremely supportive and kind throughout my appointment. Dr PERSON] was also amazing with my partner for his appointment. However, my appointment with Dr PERSON] was not good and I don’t feel comfortable talking to her again, she started off our appointment with incorrect assumptions (that I was privately diagnosed with ADHD), but she had my diagnosis letter up on her screen with the NHS logo in the corner and it also explains in the first few lines that it is Right To Choose, she immediately went on to mention the “influx of private diagnoses” and the BBC panorama, whilst I understand her concerns, her approach was not a good one at all and showed heavy skepticism which immediately make me uncomfortable. I was caught off guard and did get a little emotional but not massively, whilst she did backtrack from this once I explained how ADHD affects my life (which is why I got emotional), how it is harmful for her as a clinician to take the approach she is taking especially largely quoting a very damaging sensationalist TV program, as opposed to reliable sources, and how frustrating it is to have waited for so long to be diagnosed to be told that I may not be able to get medication when it isn’t our fault as patients that the ADHD waiting lists are so long, I wouldn’t mind doing a regular NHS assessment but the issue is that we can’t access them, not that we (as patients) don’t want to and are choosing to “pay for a diagnosis” (which I didn’t anyhow). I do sympathise with her concerns and understand as a clinician she should raise any concerns she has, my problem is that she didn’t take an open minded curious approach, and on top of that when I later read her notes on my record I realised that she has gotten the details largely incorrect (facts she recorded about my life), as well as recording that I was “upset that she needed to discuss things between the team” which isn’t the case at all, I was only upset about the approach having being caught off guard, and frustrated by the ADHD system overall given how massively it impacts my life. A more kind, curious and sympathetic approach would have been appreciated, and I don’t feel that referring to the panorama is very appropriate as a source of information given the issues with the reporting. I feel uncomfortable asking to correct the notes because I don’t want to come across as difficult or pedantic, or for it to have a negative impact on my relationship with the practice or my future care. I have had largely positive interactions with the NHS but the negative ones, including a previous misdiagnosis where the clinician ignored my concerns, have had a damaging impact on my confidence in the healthcare system and made me rather reluctant to engage with it, I try not to be cynical but it feels hard to advocate for yourself as a patient and it’s also been very difficult to access treatment aside from Right to Choose, not in terms of referrals because I’ve not experienced any issues there at all, my past GP was great with this (I haven’t yet needed any at the Chelsea practice), but in terms of waiting lists it feels a little pointless to try\n",

      "I'm very happy with the surgery's GPs, the receptionists and admin staff.  I use the PATCHS system and get a speedy response.  PATCHS is an easy digital system.  The digital communication between my Sjogren's Syndrome consultant at Charing Cross and the doctors at my surgery is excellent.  When my consultant recently sent a letter with a suggestion to the GPs, a GP contacted me the next day via PATCHS with this suggestion for further treatment if I wanted it.  The PATCHS system is used very well by me and the surgery's admin team to very quickly provide me with repeat prescriptions, send messages to a GP or the admin team, make an appointment, etc.  But, of course, there are so many patients and so few doctors to cover such a large practice that getting a speedy face-to-face appointment is impossible- unless the info a patient enters into PATCHS suggests that the symptoms indicate an emergency situation.  But fortunately and knock on wood, at 80, soon to be 81, I very rarely have any need to request an appointment. So I don't know if the waiting times for an appointment have improved since I had my last appointment for any illness well over a year ago.

      "I joined the Redcliffe Surgery in 1965. That is nearly 60 years ago. The current ethos has lost the human ethos of yesteryear, partly for reasons that cannot be overcome in the present situation of massive underfunding of the NHS, the stupidity of Brexit, ever more pressure from ever more patients, and much else. I know it is harder and harder.. BUT, if you want to improve, there is room for improvement. \n",
      "1] My wife is almost 102 years of age. I think anyone 80 yrs and more, the genuine  elderlies, need much more careful watching, and monitoring, especially in regards to the need for follow-up. Things that a specialist might ask the surgery to do are not done, as if the message never got through. \n",
      "The follow-up in the surgery needs improving more generally.\n",
      "2] It is often necessary to follow up with one's GP, and getting through to them can feel like  too many hoops to jump. If I have a blood test and get a very technical feedback, I won't understand it. The GP out to explain a complicated list of outcomes automatically. \n",
      "3] I have been seen over months by the Tissue Viability department at St Charles. When no longer seen by them, they claimed a letter to my surgery detailing my 'after care' was sent. But when I raised this with my GP, there was general non compression about what TV expected the surgery to do! I was left hanging in the air, and when an emergency arose, neither GP nor supposedly specialist nurse knew what to do. \n",
      "4] Mostly those answering the phone do a good job -- especially the person who has been there the longest -- though occasionally messages get confused, or are somehow lost in translation, so to speak.\n",
      "5] Empathy can be taught. The human element aids healing. I once was with a GP who, as I tried to explain some anxiety regarding my health, was looking at their watch. Givimng the impression, as sub-text, 'please go as fast as you can' is not good. It is anti-healing, the most basic and worst mistake. \n",
      "6] I think patients such as myself should be invited in to give feedback, and make constructive criticism, on a regular basis. Maybe a group of such people should meet occasionally with doctors.\n",

      "Getting an in person appointment is a rarity. As a family we are in relative good health so we only go to the doctors when something really doesn’t feel right. Follow up is non existent unless initiated by oneself. The doctor never follows up. Test results are not related and unless something is out of the expected range, there is no follow up to tell you about it or if the symptoms continue to discuss alternative routes of action. When readings are slightly out of range, doesnt appear to know how to interpret them and relies on the labs notes…\n",
      "If a specialist appointment is suggested, ALWAYS pushed down the private route (despite the fact we no longer have private insurance) and greatly discouraged of following the nhs route (‘don’t you read the press? Delays are inormous in hospital referrals). But that is perhaps our personal experience in particular with Dr PERSON].\n",
      "My daughter was also diagnosed with faecal impaction at A&E in C&W. We followed the protocol suggested and at that time there was a young doctor who helped tremendously. She DID do follow ups. In fact she scheduled them and would call in to check on progress. Sadly, the young lady left the practice very soon. Before leaving, she called us to let us know that she was leaving and to reassure us that she had discussed our case in details with the colleague that would be taking over. No one from the practice ever called after this lady left. What is chronic constipation that doesn’t clear over a couple of months despite obscene doses of movicol in a child, coupled with considerable weight loss? Clearly an irrelevance to this practice, or at least that is what you felt like.\n",

      "I think you have a good system generally - the phone triage system does work well once you get through. I'd love to have been able to have spoken to a doctor on the same day with my 90 year old father in a practice in Herts so I do think that is good. A ring back system on the phone line so that one does not have to wait to get through for an unknown period of time is needed. You should be able to ring back numbers that elect for a call back. It's really difficult if you are working and impossible for mothers with young children often to stay on the phone for that period of time - often the children cut off the calls! I am also uneasy how rarely one does get to see a Dr in person and I fear  things don't necessarily get picked up - the kind of things one mentions on the way out but which turn out to be important. Just by looking at someone a good GP can tell a lot. I also think it's not great if a patient has an issue such as depression but which they haven't identified themselves. The times I have been very depressed have both been identified by two doctors outside the practice and they were right. I appreciate resources are very stretched and I do think this is a good practice generally, especially when compared with others. \n",

I’ve had opportunities to move to private GP with my work health insurance but prefer Good Practice as the Drs tend to very attentive and getting an appointment with any Drs there was relatively uncomplicated. Dr PERSON] and Dr PERSON] have great bedside manner - the problem is getting an appointment when them, indeed a face to face appointment is virtually impossible with either or any Drs there. My daughter can’t get a face to face appointment for a mental health issue and I can’t get an appointment either, in each case as requested by Dr PERSON]. Recently Good Practice changed their appointment system that is inflexible and now it’s hard to get phone and in person appointment.   They have also introduced new reception staff who are not only unfriendly, but unwilling (not unable) to multi-task.  I’m not quite sure what Good Practice are trying to do but they are no longer the friendly family GP practice it used to be. It is not only disappointing but incredibly sad.\n",

Moreover, the survey timing seems random and often wrong: I was told I had two weeks to submit a reading (I have that in writing), but the survey expired after a week. Finally, I was supposed to be called by a pharmacist doctor to review my medication. I cleared time on my schedule for this and... nothing. Clearly, things aren't joined up and this is simply unacceptable. I am a patient and a person. I'm not a box that can be ticked once a text has been sent to my phone. This is no way to practice medicine. It's striking there are amazing people like PERSON] and Dr PERSON] and Dr PERSON] at ECMC - and many of the receptionists are lovely too.
